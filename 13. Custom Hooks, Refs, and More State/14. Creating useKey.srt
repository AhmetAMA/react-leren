1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:07,660
To finish this section, let's now create another custom hook called Use Key, which will abstract the

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:13,510
functionality of attaching and removing an event handler for a key press.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:22,010
So here in the movie Details component, we have that functionality that if we open a movie and then

4
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:26,990
hit the escape key on our keyboard, then it will close the movie.

5
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,240
And so we implemented that using a use effect hook.

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,450
So this one right here.

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:41,900
And so since this is using a react hook, we can abstract this into its own custom hook because actually

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:46,580
we do something very similar to focus here on the search bar.

9
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:52,940
So again, when I'm here and I hit the enter key, then that will automatically focus this.

10
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:57,380
And so that is using basically some similar functionality.

11
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:04,400
And so it's a good idea to abstract this functionality into a custom hook and then reuse that in both

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,570
these places.

13
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,820
So let's copy this code here.

14
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,480
So just copy and then let's create another file for another custom hook.

15
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,800
So this one is called use key Dot JS.

16
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:26,570
And by the way, I forgot to mention earlier that they actually also created a copy called App version

17
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,640
three before we started extracting all the custom hooks.

18
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:36,740
So basically that we can keep our code before those custom hooks were implemented.

19
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,690
Okay.

20
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,280
But anyway, let's now export the function called use key.

21
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:46,460
No.

22
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:53,890
Okay, then let's just paste this here and import use effect from React.

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,840
Okay.

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,120
And so now what do we actually need as inputs to this custom hook?

25
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:08,140
Well, this one is actually the easiest one of all because this one doesn't need to return anything.

26
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,320
And all we need is to know what should happen.

27
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:18,700
So basically we need a callback function here and we also need the user of this custom hook to tell

28
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,350
us on which key the effect here should actually be executed.

29
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,230
So not the effect, but the callback that they will pass in.

30
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,180
So we want the key.

31
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,320
For example, in this case here, that would be the escape key.

32
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,610
So here, instead of escape, we will have.

33
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,190
Just the key.

34
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:44,000
And then we want some callback for an action.

35
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,250
So just like this.

36
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:51,680
And then instead of calling of course on close movie, we.

37
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,480
Just call the action that the user passed in.

38
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,010
And here we also need the key.

39
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:06,740
And so again, never lie to react about your dependencies and always make sure to include every single

40
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,190
variable that is used here into your effect.

41
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:20,120
Okay, now here we just need one small fix, so to say, because the user might pass in this key like

42
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,080
in different formats.

43
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:31,340
So they might write escape like this or maybe all in lowercase or maybe by mistake they write like this.

44
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:39,350
And so what we should do here is to just transform this key that they pass in to lowercase.

45
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:49,850
And then also the code that we get from the event to lowercase as well so that we can then correctly

46
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,780
compare them.

47
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,950
And that's a pretty normal thing to do when we compare strings.

48
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,040
And so this should at this point already be working.

49
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:05,770
So let's come back here and then let's use use key.

50
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:12,160
So again, make sure that the file was correctly imported.

51
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,100
And if it didn't, then go ahead and do this line of code yourself now.

52
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,020
And so here we now need to pass in the key.

53
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:27,160
So that's in this case, the escape key.

54
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,390
So we want to replace this effect right here.

55
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:39,650
And so that's again, the escape key and the action will be on close movie.

56
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,340
So this function right here with the difference that of course now we do not call the function, but

57
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,780
instead we will allow react to call this function at a later point.

58
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:57,290
So basically, when this event happens and the key is the escape key.

59
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,970
So this whole functionality is now inside that function.

60
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,600
And so just to make sure, let's reload.

61
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,420
Let's open up some movie.

62
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,040
Hit the escape key and nice.

63
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:23,010
So our custom hook is working, and so let's now immediately reuse it in this search component.

64
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,020
So where is that?

65
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:34,070
And of course, if I were writing this application for myself, I would have long divided this file

66
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,810
into multiple components.

67
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,430
So this is the last one.

68
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,490
We will have one big file with everything.

69
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:45,020
But anyway, let's now again use use key here.

70
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,060
And so this time, the key that we are looking for is the enter key.

71
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,130
Like this.

72
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:59,450
But now, as for the callback function, this is actually a little bit more tricky because what at what

73
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,060
we have here as the callback function.

74
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:09,040
So we have all this where this part here, of course, is already in the custom hook.

75
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:13,940
So where it compares the pressed key with the key that we're interested in here.

76
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:18,980
So basically this action here is corresponding to this part.

77
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,770
So we could.

78
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:28,310
Pass in a callback function like this only with these two pieces.

79
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,070
But then we would miss out on this part.

80
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,380
So we also need to include that there.

81
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:41,970
So this would then be like cutting it from here and pasting it here, which would not alter the functionality

82
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,530
of this code at all.

83
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,110
And so let's do the same thing here.

84
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:51,240
So basically what we have here should now be just the callback function here.

85
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,980
All right.

86
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,150
And so then we can get rid of all this here once again.

87
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:05,800
And also of this comment, since we also have this in that other file that I stored.

88
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:08,720
And so let's see if this works again.

89
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,920
So hitting the enter key and yes, that works just as well.

90
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,530
So here the callback function.

91
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:23,110
So this action, as we called it in our hook, is a little bit different.

92
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,940
So a bit longer than before.

93
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:30,970
But all it does is to just describe what we want to happen when the enter key is pressed.

94
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:32,870
Nice.

95
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:39,710
So with this, we finished this part about custom hooks and actually we finished this entire application.

96
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,960
So we are done with this app.

97
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,160
Let's just see why there are some problems here.

98
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,960
Let's reload that.

99
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,910
Okay, so that was from something else.

100
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:55,130
But anyway, we finished.

101
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,490
Now this application and this section as well.

102
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:05,270
And so just like always, all there's left to do is one more coding challenge where you will now practice

103
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:08,450
to build your own custom hook on your own.

104
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:15,230
So don't skip that video because it's pretty important that you start getting into the habit of writing

105
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,670
these hooks on your own.
