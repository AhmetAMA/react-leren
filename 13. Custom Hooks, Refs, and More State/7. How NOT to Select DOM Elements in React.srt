00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,870
The soul with the topic of youth state now behind us.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,400
Let's turn our focus on something called refs.

3
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:16,270
And so in this lecture, let's manually select a Dom element so that you see why we actually need refs

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,500
in React.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:24,630
So as an experiment, let's try to automatically give this input element here.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,790
Focus each time that the search component mounts.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,640
So basically, each time the application mounts, we will automatically focus on this input field.

8
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:37,360
Okay.

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,130
And in order to do that, we actually need to select this element.

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,450
And so let's try to do that with the tools that we already have.

11
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:53,980
So we come here into our search component, which is where that input field is located.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,650
And so then we can basically use a use effect and then manually select this Dom element right here.

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,610
So let's try that out.

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:14,550
And then let's execute this effect as soon as this component mounts.

15
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:22,860
So let's create some element by simply doing document dot query selector.

16
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,380
And then we can just use the class name that is already here on the element.

17
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,870
So dot search.

18
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,180
No.

19
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:32,860
Okay.

20
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,720
Just to see if this works.

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,970
Let's lock this to the console.

22
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,770
And you see that indeed there is our input field.

23
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:53,360
And so now what we can do is to just say L so just this element and then call the focus method on that.

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,070
And so this is just some straightforward, typical Dom manipulation.

25
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,230
Okay.

26
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:07,730
And so now if we load the application and so you see as the application first loaded, this input field

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,040
automatically got focused.

28
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,210
So our code here is basically doing its job.

29
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:21,590
However, as we learned at the very beginning, React is all about being declarative and so manually

30
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:27,440
selecting a Dom element like this is not really the react way of doing things.

31
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,700
So it's not in line with the rest of our React code.

32
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:39,590
So in React, we really don't want to manually add event listeners like this And also having to add

33
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,020
classes or IDs just for the purpose of selecting is not really nice.

34
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,800
And again, not really the react way of doing things.

35
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:55,280
So here we already had the class name of course, but if we didn't, then we would have to now add that

36
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,510
class name or ID here to then use it in the effect to select the element.

37
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,640
Also, if for some reason we would need some dependency here.

38
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:12,020
For example, if this code should rerun each time the query changes, then that would mean that we would

39
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:17,300
select the element here over and over again, which is also not ideal.

40
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,090
Okay.

41
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:26,630
And so to solve all these problems and to make the action of selecting an elements more declarative,

42
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,780
such as everything else in React, we need the concept of refs.

43
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:35,360
And so that's what we're going to learn about in the next video.
