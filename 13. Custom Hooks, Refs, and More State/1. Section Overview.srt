00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,600
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:07,980
In this section, we're going to dive even deeper into React hooks.

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:15,660
So I like to say that hooks are easy to learn in the beginning, but hard to really master.

4
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:23,520
However, a really solid understanding of hooks is crucial for all React developers.

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:31,050
That's why over the next few videos we'll understand the rules of hooks and why they exist.

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,310
Learn even more about the use datak.

7
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,710
Explore the use ref hook and even create our own react hooks.

8
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:49,140
Now we won't revisit the use effect hook yet because we will inspect it even further at a later point.

9
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:55,530
But anyway, let's get back to work and finish building this project.
