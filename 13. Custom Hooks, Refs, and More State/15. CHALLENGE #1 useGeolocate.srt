1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:08,350
In this challenge, let's practice creating a custom hook based on some code that is already working.

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:17,110
So here we have a very simple application, which all it does is to get your position using geo location

3
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,540
as soon as you click on this button.

4
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:26,500
So when you click here, your browser will automatically ask for your permission and then when you allow,

5
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:34,150
it will give you your position and the link which you can click and which will bring you to the OpenStreetMap

6
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,300
application on your location.

7
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:38,680
No.

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:39,310
Okay.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,530
Also, the app then clicks how many times you have requested your position.

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:49,120
And so if I click here again, then it changes to two and it loads again.

11
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,170
Okay.

12
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:58,420
And as I was saying in the beginning, I already have all of this code working here in your starter

13
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,050
file.

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:03,130
So the application again is already working just fine.

15
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:08,220
And you can of course check out all the code that I wrote here.

16
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,580
But what matters is this other code.

17
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:16,060
So all of this here outside of the JS return.

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:25,910
So my task for you now is to extract this logic into a custom hook called use geolocation and then use

19
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:29,540
that custom hook to make this component work again.

20
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,810
So working in the exact same way as before.

21
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,980
Now I want you to think about the fact that a custom hook should be as reusable as possible.

22
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:47,210
And so, of course I want you to write a use geolocation hook that you could then use in any other app

23
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,740
that you will ever build.

24
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:56,460
So if we think about this, then maybe those future apps where you might need this custom hook, they

25
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,140
don't want to count how many times we have clicked on the button here.

26
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,100
Right?

27
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:07,890
And so this state right here might not really be relevant to this custom hook.

28
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:15,480
So this custom hook should really only contain the logic that is about getting the position from geolocation.

29
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,170
And so that's what I want you to think about while you are doing this exercise.

30
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:27,780
So again, basically make sure to not include this state here, which indicates how many times the button

31
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,770
has been clicked.

32
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:32,860
So that's a small additional challenge, but I'm sure you can do it.

33
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,930
And again, the goal is to then have the application in the end look and work exactly as it is working

34
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,770
right now.

35
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:46,650
So take all the time that you need and then see you back here with my quick solution.

36
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,660
So let's get to work.

37
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,470
And so let's grab all the logic that is related to the geolocation.

38
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,330
So that's all the state.

39
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:05,650
And also this event handler here, except for this counter here.

40
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,750
And for now, also, except this part here, although that is debatable.

41
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,660
But let's just comment this out for now.

42
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:17,870
So let's grab all this code right here.

43
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,800
Cut it and then paste it here.

44
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,990
But of course now we will need to adjust a few things.

45
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:33,580
And the first one is that, of course, now this counting logic here is no longer part of Getposition.

46
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,860
So let's cut that from here.

47
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:39,140
And paste it into some function here.

48
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,450
So let's say handle click.

49
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,350
And then let's do that here.

50
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:57,100
And so then here we will actually call that other function, because inside Handleclick is where we

51
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:03,970
will then update the count clicks state and also actually get the position.

52
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,490
So let's say for now.

53
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:09,820
But of course, we are now missing all of these variables here.

54
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:16,690
And so just like we did previously, we now need to return all those variables from our hook.

55
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,740
So that is actually pretty easy.

56
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,340
So let's just return an object.

57
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,780
So it is loading with position.

58
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,800
With the error and then also with the get position function.

59
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:37,880
All right.

60
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,940
And then we see here we have no longer any yellow underlinings.

61
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,130
All we have now yellow is this function because we are not using it anywhere.

62
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,930
So let's change that.

63
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,390
So use geolocation.

64
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,310
And then this will, of course, return an object with these names here.

65
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,930
So let's just copy that.

66
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,250
That's a bit easier.

67
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:10,140
So we will destructure all of that right here into these four variables.

68
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:17,580
Now, you could also have done this destructuring here, right here inside the geolocation.

69
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:23,190
And then instead of returning the position, you could have returned the latitude and the longitude

70
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,060
separately.

71
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:31,530
But here I just returned all of them at once and we can now actually do nested destructuring so we can

72
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:35,580
also immediately destructure the position right here.

73
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:45,310
Let and LNG and they are called this way because here we are constructing that position object with

74
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,460
these exact property names.

75
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:53,150
Okay, then we don't need this anymore.

76
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:58,490
And then here all we have to do is to also call get position.

77
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,550
And with this we should be good to go.

78
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,650
So let's just reload here.

79
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:08,100
And there we go.

80
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,370
So the state updating works here and here as well.

81
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:17,150
And of course, our link is also still working.

82
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,500
Nice.

83
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:21,740
So that's actually already it.

84
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:28,820
So this was a fast one, but also a very important challenge, which hopefully made it even more clear

85
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,260
how we create our own custom hooks.

86
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:38,750
So basically we take all the non-visual logic, so all the logic that contains some react hooks and

87
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,630
which is relevant to a certain thing.

88
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,590
And so in this case, that thing is to use geolocation.

89
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:53,540
So then we took these three state variables and also this event handler function and then returned all

90
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,620
of that from here and used it here.

91
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:03,170
And so then we encapsulated all of those states and all the logic inside this custom hook.

92
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:11,070
Then of course, this state we left outside, which then forced us to do a couple of changes here in

93
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,690
the event handler for the button.

94
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,600
But all that is pretty simple.

95
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,870
And so I hope that you had some fun with this and that you're now ready to move to the section.

96
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,580
That is coming up next.

97
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,080
So see you there.
