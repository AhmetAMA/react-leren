1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:08,610
So we used composition in order to solve a prop drilling problem and to build our layout in a way nicer

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,150
way.

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:14,220
And so now let's use it to build a reusable box component.

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:23,800
So we already converted the list box component here to use the children prop in order to then basically

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,200
fill that slot.

6
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:30,100
So that whole with this component that we pass in as a child component.

7
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:35,860
And so now we could go ahead and do the exact same thing with the watched box.

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:37,810
So let's actually go there.

9
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,410
So what?

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,580
Box.

11
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,100
And it's right here.

12
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:51,000
However, if we take a look at this component right here, it is very, very similar to that other box.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,410
So to that.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,080
A list box.

15
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:59,620
So basically both of them have this state here of is open.

16
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:05,720
Then they have a div with the class of box and then they have this button which is also exactly the

17
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,200
same.

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,920
And in the end they will render their children conditionally.

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,680
So based on the is open state.

20
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,900
So again, if we go here, we will see that it is basically exactly the same.

21
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:24,040
This one here has this watched state, but we can easily move that somewhere else.

22
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:30,810
So what I'm saying is that both the watched box and the movie box have this same state here.

23
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:36,930
Basically, they have this same class name, this same button, and then they render something conditionally

24
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,700
based on the open state.

25
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,770
And so this is an amazing candidate to create a reusable component.

26
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,790
So let's do that and let's do it separately actually, of the other ones.

27
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,670
And I will simply call it box.

28
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,750
Let me.

29
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,520
Just to make this a bit easier.

30
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:03,750
Cut this one and paste it close to the other one and then we can see how similar they actually are.

31
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,490
And you know what?

32
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,130
I will actually not create a new one, but I will immediately convert this one here because the list

33
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,860
box is basically already what we want.

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,800
So let's just recall it box.

35
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,320
Then here we no longer need like this name here of is open one.

36
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,800
And set is open one.

37
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,680
Let's change that here, change that here and here, and that's already it.

38
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,100
So we no longer need this watched box.

39
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,980
So it's completely comment that one out.

40
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,470
And so let's now use this box.

41
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,390
Here inside of this list box that we're using.

42
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,430
So box right here.

43
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,360
Let's remove that one for now.

44
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,440
And box here as well.

45
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,250
And well, for some I had the wrong one here open still.

46
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:10,250
So just to make sure let's reload and to this part still looks exactly the same as before.

47
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,060
And so now we can use this reusable box.

48
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:27,010
And simply pass in that content that we passed before into the watched box, which is basically this.

49
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,430
Right.

50
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,720
So copy that.

51
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,340
And.

52
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,720
Let's paste that here.

53
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,450
And now we get the problem, which I was saying before, which is that this watched array here now needs

54
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:44,270
to be moved onto this component.

55
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,350
So this state that we had before can no longer live here.

56
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,790
But it couldn't anyway, as we will see in a future section.

57
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,030
So we would have to place this here anyway and.

58
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,620
So, yeah, this fixes the problem and we shouldn't even need.

59
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,340
Uh, this right here.

60
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,230
And so there we go.

61
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:12,440
We just created ourselves a reusable box component.

62
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:17,170
And the state now works, of course, still in both.

63
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:24,140
And so we didn't have to rewrite that same state logic and the same button here in both of these lists

64
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,070
because again, they were basically exactly the same.

65
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:36,530
And so what we did again, was to create this reusable box and in there allow for any children to be

66
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:37,400
passed in.

67
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,750
So we created like this empty hole here ready to receive any components that we want, which in this

68
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,520
case is the movies list.

69
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,250
And in this case it's the watched summary and the watched list.

70
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,730
So here we have just one children component and here we have two.

71
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,890
But no matter what, our box always works for all of these situations.

72
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:09,240
And so again, all of this logic here, so this button here with setting the open state could just be

73
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,740
reused in this way.

74
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:19,170
And on top of that, as a bonus, we made our application tree here even more explicit in the app component.

75
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:24,780
So now it really is very clear what exactly is happening in the application.

76
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:31,560
Just by looking at this one component, we can immediately see the entire structure of the application,

77
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,310
which is really, really helpful.

78
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,890
So this is really great and we're moving into some more intermediate React territory, but that makes

79
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:47,190
complete sense because we are already in part two, which is exactly for intermediate react.

80
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:53,460
So it's great that at this point we are already able to do something like this, which is already way

81
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,420
closer to how real world react applications look like.

82
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:04,830
So really, really keep this technique of component composition in mind, both for building better layouts,

83
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:11,550
for solving prop drilling and also for creating reusable components like this one.

84
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,030
So hopefully you saw how powerful this is.

85
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:21,300
And so as you start writing your own code, be on the watch out for whenever you can do this.

86
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:27,990
So whenever you can create some reusable components in your own code using this amazing technique.
