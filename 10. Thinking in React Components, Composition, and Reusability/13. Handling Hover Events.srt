1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,800
Let's now handle the event of users hovering over our stars.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,580
So basically the functionality that we're looking for is this one.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:17,540
So whenever we hover over these stars, we get like a temporary rating here.

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,360
Exactly.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,890
With the number of stars that are currently being hovered.

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,890
So here we have nine, here we have three, but it is completely independent from the rating that is

7
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:30,660
actually set right now.

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,790
So the rating is set to five.

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:40,290
But again, whenever we hover over some other number of stars, then that temporarily changes to that

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:41,040
rating.

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,360
All right.

12
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,900
So what that means is that now we need a brand new piece of state to basically store that temporary

13
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,590
rating.

14
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,540
And again, that makes sense because something should happen on the screen.

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,700
So the component should rerender whenever there is some hover event.

16
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:02,880
That's how we then get that new rating in there.

17
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,880
So let's say.

18
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:14,150
For example, temp rating, which stands for temporary and then set.

19
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,770
Temp rating.

20
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,590
And we start at zero.

21
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,940
And of course, the rating itself should also start at zero.

22
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:37,310
Now, right now, in order to actually handle that hover event, let's go down here onto our star.

23
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,000
So into our start component.

24
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:44,350
And then where we handle the click is where we also handle the hover.

25
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:52,480
Now there is not really a hover event, but instead we have on mouse enter.

26
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,360
So let's just do some console.log here for now.

27
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,710
So that's one of them.

28
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,800
And then we have mouse leaf.

29
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,850
So we basically need to handle these two separately.

30
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,210
Okay.

31
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,350
Just so that we can quickly see.

32
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,720
So I entered basically this element and then it said Enter.

33
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,660
And immediately afterwards it said Leave.

34
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:29,190
So let's see again.

35
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,640
And indeed, each time that we enter or leave.

36
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,280
Well, we get our log down there.

37
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:42,450
And so now all we have to do is to update that temp rating state that we just created in each of these

38
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,500
situations.

39
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:53,290
So let's pass in then to handler functions here into the star, just like we did for the on rate.

40
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,450
So let's call this one here on hover in.

41
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:06,590
And the prop name here is different again from the event name just to avoid some confusion here.

42
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:14,120
So we could also call this prop on mouse enter again, but then it might be a bit confusing and you

43
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:20,870
might think that the event is actually handled right here on the star component, which of course is

44
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:21,710
not possible.

45
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:26,720
So the event always needs to be handled on a JSX element itself.

46
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:30,880
So like an HTML element such as a span.

47
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,110
Okay.

48
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,120
And now all we have to do here.

49
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:41,520
Is to basically set the temp rating to the rating of the current star.

50
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,070
So that's again, I plus one.

51
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,450
Right.

52
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:49,170
And then on hover out.

53
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,670
We set it back to the initial value.

54
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:57,050
So temp rating.

55
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,530
Back to zero.

56
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:03,590
So here we need to change the name.

57
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:07,670
So of course, this is with an uppercase R.

58
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:15,450
And now all we need to do is to accept these two props here and wire everything together.

59
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,250
So on hover in.

60
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,100
On.

61
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,840
Hover out.

62
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,060
All right.

63
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,480
And so then here we, of course, want to now call these functions.

64
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,990
And here.

65
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:37,640
On.

66
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,050
Hover out.

67
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:45,760
And now finally, we need to actually display this rating in the UI.

68
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,370
So you see here right now that it's still yellow, which means that we haven't used it anywhere.

69
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,490
So let's for now replace this rating with the temp rating.

70
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,060
And then let's see.

71
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,080
And yeah, that's already working.

72
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:07,890
So see how that value was there.

73
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:14,080
Shortly we had the three, then here, the four, the five and so on and so forth.

74
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,100
So that's working great.

75
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,100
The only part that is not working is that the stars are not getting full.

76
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:27,130
And so let's quickly fix that here inside this condition here.

77
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:34,810
So here we can say that if there is a temp rating, so if there is a temporary rating, then do the

78
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,710
same thing.

79
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:38,890
But with that temp rating.

80
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:44,560
So then temp rating greater or equal I plus one.

81
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:49,030
But if not, well, then we just do what we had before.

82
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,790
And so this should fix that.

83
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,490
And yeah, beautiful.

84
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,130
So that works great.

85
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:04,240
And if we click here, well, then the number disappears, but the stars stay the same.

86
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,480
And so that's because now we have the rating set.

87
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:15,130
And then so here in this full prop, we enter the second branch, which then just like before, sets

88
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,860
these four stars here to full.

89
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:26,410
Now all we have to do here is to place another order here and say basically if there is no temp rating,

90
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,790
then display.

91
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,080
The current rating.

92
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,000
And if that also doesn't exist.

93
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,130
Well, then we get the empty string.

94
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,270
So indeed, we now get four.

95
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,490
If we click again, we get five.

96
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,860
But as we hover, we get the temporary rating.

97
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:49,010
So just like we wanted and just like this component here works as well.

98
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,470
So this looks really nice.

99
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:54,960
Really real world, actually.

100
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,180
And it wasn't that much work.

101
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:04,320
All we had to do is some tricks with these two rating states and then handling all of these different

102
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,140
events.

103
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:11,070
So basically handling the click, the mouse enter and the mouse leave and the result.

104
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,930
If you ask me, is even a bit magical here.

105
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,780
So I really, really like this effect that we created here.

106
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,160
Okay.

107
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,960
And so that's the main functionality already implemented.

108
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,660
But now let's make the component really, really flexible by allowing a couple of props.

109
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:37,890
So we will learn all about that in the next lecture and then we will come back here and create the API

110
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,140
basically of this component.
