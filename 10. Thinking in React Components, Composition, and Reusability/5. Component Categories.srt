00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:07,940
Now that we have created a few different components, let's quickly talk about different component categories

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,780
that naturally emerge in most React code bases.

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:21,440
So most of your components will naturally fall into one of three categories stateless or presentational

4
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,400
components.

5
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:26,480
Stateful components or structural components.

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:33,380
And I say naturally, because we shouldn't force our components into one of these categories.

7
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:38,490
Now these are all still normal react components in our code.

8
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:45,410
So just like the ones that we have been writing, but we can categorize them in this way when we think

9
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:46,850
about components.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,360
There are also other categories that could be used, but I think that these make the most sense.

11
00:00:54,060 --> 00:01:02,340
So starting with stateless or presentational components, as the name says, these don't have any state.

12
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:10,110
Usually they are components that receive some props and then they simply present that data or even some

13
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,280
other content and therefore the name presentational.

14
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:22,260
Many times these are quite small components such as the logo num results and movie components in our

15
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,160
current app.

16
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,590
Next.

17
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,210
Stateful components are simply components that do have state.

18
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:36,240
Now, just because these components have state, that doesn't mean that they can't be highly reusable.

19
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:44,780
For example, the search component that we built does have state and we could reuse this input as many

20
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,450
times as we wanted throughout the app.

21
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:56,140
Now, finally, you can think of structural components as pages, layouts or screens of the application,

22
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,840
which are oftentimes the result of composing many smaller components together.

23
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:05,740
And more about composition later in this section.

24
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:13,640
So these structural components can be large and non reusable components, but they don't have to.

25
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:17,540
Structural components are sometimes quite small too.

26
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:25,040
What matters is that they are responsible for providing some sort of structure to applications such

27
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,350
as pages or layouts.

28
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:34,460
Therefore, these components might not be present in really small apps, but you will definitely have

29
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,930
a few structural components as your app grows bigger and bigger.
