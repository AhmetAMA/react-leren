1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:06,240
Now, we left a small problem in one of the components that we just created earlier.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,140
And so let's now go fix that problem and in the process, discover the problem of prop drilling.

3
00:00:14,710 --> 00:00:21,250
But before we go do that, I just want to very quickly review the previous lecture by classifying each

4
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:26,260
of our components into one of the categories that we just looked at.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:34,060
So I think that clearly both the app and the navbar component here are structural components.

6
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:40,150
So they are only responsible for the structure or for the layout of the application.

7
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:44,410
And the same can also be said of this main component here.

8
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,550
So those are for providing structure.

9
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:55,300
Then the logo here is clearly a presentational component, so it doesn't have any state and so therefore

10
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:59,050
it's stateless and it simply presents some content here.

11
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:07,660
Then the search is of course a stateful component, then numb results is just a presentational component

12
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,230
here.

13
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,730
Main we already talked about.

14
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,830
Then we have the list box, which clearly is a stateful component.

15
00:01:16,730 --> 00:01:19,550
At the same for the movie list.

16
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,660
And for the what box?

17
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,910
So those are all stateful components.

18
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:32,050
While the movie simply receives this prop right here and then presents that data in the user interface.

19
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:36,970
So movie here is just a stateless or presentational component.

20
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:42,070
Then we have this one here, which is also a presentational component.

21
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,820
At the same for this one.

22
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,120
So watched movies list and watched movie.

23
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:50,860
All right.

24
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,150
And that's actually it.

25
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,660
I just wanted to quickly categorize each of them.

26
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:01,780
But now let's move on to that problem that I mentioned in the very beginning, and that is that right

27
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:06,360
now here we are not dynamically calculating the number of results.

28
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:12,670
So we are not basically taking the list of movies and reading how many there are and then displaying

29
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,360
it here.

30
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,430
So that's what we want to do.

31
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:24,400
But yeah, now we only have this X, So what we need basically is to get access to the movies state

32
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,650
right here in Num results.

33
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,310
Now, where does that state live right now?

34
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,760
Well, it's here inside of movies list.

35
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,130
So right here.

36
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:41,800
So, again, it's here, but we also need it here in num results.

37
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,470
So what's the solution to that?

38
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:47,620
And I really hope you already know at this point.

39
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:53,810
Well, the solution is to lift the state up to the closest parent component.

40
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,140
And what parent is that?

41
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,460
Well, it's the app component, right?

42
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:04,090
So it's not the nav bar because, of course, that's not a parent of movie list.

43
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:06,970
And so it is really the app component.

44
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:15,120
So what we need to do is to cut this from here and place it right back into the app component.

45
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:17,640
All right.

46
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,100
And now we need to pass it down as a prop to where we need it.

47
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:26,670
And so this is where the problem of prop drilling will come into play.

48
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:34,380
So again, we need now this state in order to make this work again inside of the movie list.

49
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:40,260
But this movie list is really deeply nested inside this component tree, Right?

50
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:47,130
So it has these two parent components, which now will also need to receive that state as a prop.

51
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,880
But instead of talking, let's actually do this.

52
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,020
So movies equals movies?

53
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,570
So now we have the movies array inside Main.

54
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,030
So let's go there.

55
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,110
And we need to receive it here.

56
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,350
Now, then we need to pass it here right into the watched box or actually into the list box.

57
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,390
So movies.

58
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,350
Equal movies.

59
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,510
Or actually here.

60
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:19,690
Yeah.

61
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,740
It's not Maine.

62
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,690
Of course it's movies.

63
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,280
Okay, so now we got it inside the main.

64
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,710
And now we got it inside the list box.

65
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:34,200
So let's come here and do it all again.

66
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:40,020
So accepting it here and then passing it here.

67
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,440
So movies, equal movies.

68
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,970
And so what we are doing right now is what we call prop drilling.

69
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,910
So now we finally accept it here and then it works again.

70
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,050
So basically, prop drilling means that we need to pass some prop through several nested child components

71
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:09,190
in order to get that data into some deeply nested component, which in this case is this one.

72
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:14,890
So we had to pass this movie's prop here first into the main.

73
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,530
Then.

74
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:23,780
Well from the main into the list box and then from the list box into the movie list.

75
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,280
And so all these components, they didn't actually even need this prop.

76
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,870
All they needed this for was to then pass it down even further the tree.

77
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:37,850
And so we end up with a lot of props that are really not needed at all.

78
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:44,030
All they are needed for is to pass the data down even further into our component tree.

79
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,530
So this is what prop drilling is and you saw that it is not a lot of fun and it could be even worse,

80
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,640
of course, if the data was nested even deeper into the tree.

81
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:01,190
So this was just like three levels deep, but it could be like 5 or 10 levels.

82
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,370
And so then it would become a little bit out of control.

83
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,370
So we will look at ways of fixing prop drilling a bit later in this section.

84
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:15,890
But for now, let's finally also make this prop.

85
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,200
So this movie's data available right here where we also need it.

86
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:22,950
So right here.

87
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,480
So movies.

88
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,080
Equal movies.

89
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:34,490
And so now we have to do some prop drilling again because here we need to again, accept this prop,

90
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:36,080
but we don't need it here.

91
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,310
All we need it for is to pass it down again.

92
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:45,190
But here it's not so bad because it's really just one level.

93
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,580
Okay.

94
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:54,740
And now finally, movies dot length.

95
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,970
And so.

96
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,660
Tada!

97
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,120
We got three results.

98
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,650
Nice.

99
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,950
So this works.

100
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:08,130
And what we just did here is a perfectly valid solution to make the application work, of course.

101
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:15,180
But as I mentioned, what we did was some so-called prop drilling, which is not always the best solution,

102
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,760
especially if we need to pass that prop down really, really deep into the tree.

103
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:26,550
And so in the next lecture, we will take a look at one of the possible solutions to this problem,

104
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,070
which is component composition.
