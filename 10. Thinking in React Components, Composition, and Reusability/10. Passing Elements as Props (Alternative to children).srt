00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:07,670
In the lecture about component composition, I said that we can use the children prop for composition

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,420
or an explicitly defined prop.

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:14,300
And so let's now quickly explore that second option.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:23,020
So instead of using the children, prop in a component and then passing in a component like this, we

5
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:26,290
can use an explicit prop as an alternative.

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:31,640
So let me show you what I mean by first commenting out all of this.

7
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:35,330
And then we can go to the box component.

8
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:43,610
So down here and now, instead of accepting children here, let's say we accept something called element

9
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,130
and it can really be called anything.

10
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,980
So just L or really whatever.

11
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:58,000
And so now we can go back up here and include the box in the old way.

12
00:00:58,010 --> 00:01:00,050
So closing it immediately.

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:07,220
But then we can specify the element prop and now here we can then do exactly what we had here.

14
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,660
So let's copy that and paste it.

15
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,240
Give it a save.

16
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,530
And that worked.

17
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:21,970
So now we have our movie list like here, and it was passed into the box component as an explicit prop,

18
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,240
in this case a prop called element.

19
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:33,650
So before what we had here is that we were basically implicitly passing in this component into the box,

20
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:36,560
and then we read it there with the children prop.

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,000
But here we now basically pass it in more explicitly.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,560
So we really say that we have an element prop and then we place whatever we want to pass in right here.

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:56,420
So right into the element prop and this pattern is used in some library, for example, in React router.

24
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,130
And so this is why I thought it might be interesting to show this to you right now.

25
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:03,290
And of course we can do the same.

26
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,650
With the.

27
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,410
Other box here.

28
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,140
So simply saying.

29
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,060
Element.

30
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,080
And then this.

31
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:18,160
Now here, basically we are passing in a brand new piece of JSX.

32
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,270
And so here we now actually need a fragment.

33
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,090
Give it a safe.

34
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,410
And there we go.

35
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:32,280
So the app now looks exactly the same as before, but we basically passed in an element or multiple

36
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,250
elements here instead of using the children prop.

37
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,380
But the result is exactly the same.

38
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,600
And under the hood inside react.

39
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,990
It should also be basically exactly the same.

40
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:49,350
So this can be a viable pattern in case you need to pass in multiple elements and give them separate

41
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,070
names.

42
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:57,780
So that would be a perfectly fine use case for using something like an element prop or really any other

43
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,160
prop with any other name instead of the implicit children prop.

44
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:09,300
But in our case, let's go back to what we had before because I think it looks a lot nicer, actually.

45
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,700
And it's also clearly the preferred way of doing this inside react.

46
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,160
So this was really just to show you.

47
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:19,770
So I will just delete this entire code.

48
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:28,010
And put this one here back and then let's go to the box and fix it there as well.

49
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:36,140
And by the way, let me show you a very nice trick in VS code, which is that if you hover over any

50
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:43,760
component here and then hit command on the Mac or control on Windows, we can actually go right to the

51
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,740
definition of the function.

52
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:53,450
So in this case of the component so I'm hovering box here, then I hit the command key click and then

53
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,190
I immediately move there.

54
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:01,850
And what's even nicer is that if we do the same down here, so again, hitting the command or the control

55
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,090
key, then we go right back up.

56
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:11,750
Well, in this case, somehow it doesn't work, but usually it should.

57
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:18,620
But yeah, what matters is that we can move from where the component is called into the place where

58
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,980
it is actually defined.

59
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,830
And so now let's change element back to children.

60
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,780
And then we have just what we had before.

61
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,820
So this was really just to show you an alternative way of using component composition without the children

62
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,360
prop.

63
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:41,240
But again, using children is by far the preferred way of doing things.
