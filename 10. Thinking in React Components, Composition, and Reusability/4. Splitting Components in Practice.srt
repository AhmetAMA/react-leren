1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:08,850
So let's now split one huge components into many small ones using the framework that we just learned

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:09,570
about.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:16,520
Now, as always to start, we need to get our starter files here from this folder.

4
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,740
So let's grab.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,200
These two.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,100
And then let's move back to our project folder.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:33,340
And as always, I'm renaming it and then let's paste the new files right in here into the source folder.

8
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:40,210
And then we need to replace these and just get rid of some of this garbage that we have here.

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,150
All right.

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:47,420
So as always, we just end up with Index.js.

11
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:50,860
Index.css and App.js.

12
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,650
Then we just grab all this.

13
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,500
And open it in vs code.

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,550
As always.

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,630
Close down this one.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,180
And.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,330
Yeah, then we need to clean up this file here.

18
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,850
And so this is always a little bit of tedious work, but we just have to do it.

19
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:15,160
And actually that's already done.

20
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,990
You can take a look here at the CSS if you'd like, because there's actually a lot of it to make this

21
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:23,340
application here work.

22
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,950
So to style that application.

23
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,900
But what matters most to us is of course this app dot JS.

24
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,790
So here we have this array of objects that I talked about in the previous lecture.

25
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:37,160
Here.

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,200
Then we have another array of objects, which is for this watch list.

27
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,350
And then here we have that huge component that I was talking about.

28
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,080
So it has all this JS inside.

29
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:58,070
So basically all of this, the entire application is now inside of one component.

30
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:04,100
To prove that to you, let's actually start this application here because this one here is of course

31
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,060
still the demo.

32
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,260
So let's open up our integrated terminal.

33
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,740
That's slightly too big and then npm start.

34
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:19,290
So that should then open up a new tab in here.

35
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,020
And there it is.

36
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,230
So make this even smaller.

37
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,430
And yeah, so there is the app.

38
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:35,690
And as I was saying in the first lecture, it does work here in terms of collapsing these two lists,

39
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,840
also writing something in here.

40
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:43,670
So all of that is working and it's all working within this one huge component.

41
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:50,780
And so I thought that it was a nice exercise to basically pretend that we're working on some team and

42
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:57,560
that one of our team members created this huge component and now it's our task to take it and split

43
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,760
it up into small components that make it easy to work with and well, which isn't this huge mess.

44
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,520
So let's use the framework that we learned about in the previous lecture to do that.

45
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,720
So let's take a look at our JS here.

46
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:20,270
And if you want, you can, of course, pause the video and do that on your own because there is a lot

47
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,620
to unpack here.

48
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,760
So we have this nav bar here.

49
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,670
So this entire thing here is this nav element.

50
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,390
And then we have this main part, which is all of this.

51
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:40,080
Then inside the nave, we have this box here for this left side, which contains this list.

52
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,000
And then we have another box on the right side which contains all of this, but we will take care of

53
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:47,910
that later.

54
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:54,800
So for now, let's basically split up all of this here into the nav bar and into this main part.

55
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:01,100
So I think to start, that's the best logical separation of the content, which is remember the first

56
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,920
criteria that we talked about.

57
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:10,850
So those were logical separation of content, second reusability, third responsibilities and complexity,

58
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,880
and fourth, the personal coding style.

59
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:20,120
So this nav bar here and the main content here, they really don't belong together.

60
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,670
And so that's a good idea then to create a component for each of them.

61
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:31,790
So I'm cutting this code here and I will actually now create these components here on top.

62
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,070
Otherwise, I have to scroll too much.

63
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,620
So let's write function nav bar.

64
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,130
And then return simply this.

65
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:44,960
Give it a safe.

66
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,940
And now it's complaining here.

67
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,280
So we now need to also move this date here into this other component.

68
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:55,890
So this one here is depending on query and set query.

69
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,070
And so therefore, we need to move that state right there.

70
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:05,970
And so actually having all the state here was another great indicator that this component here had way

71
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,650
too many responsibilities.

72
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:12,510
So we have five pieces of state and then these three derived states.

73
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,220
So that's way too much.

74
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,140
So let's just cut this here.

75
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,690
Paste that here and here.

76
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,980
We also need the movies.

77
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,580
But for now, just replace this here with an X.

78
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:31,450
Okay, so now the nav bar is gone because, of course, we haven't yet included it here.

79
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,620
And so.

80
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,870
Let's do that.

81
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,380
And now our app looks just like before.

82
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,830
So now let's then grab all this other code.

83
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,160
All of this.

84
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:51,620
Cut it and put it into yet another component.

85
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,980
And this one, let's actually call it main.

86
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:02,140
And as we save it, it will now complain that it needs all of these states here.

87
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,510
So for now, let's just grab everything and paste that here.

88
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,960
All right.

89
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,740
And then well, we just have to include, of course, that Maine right here.

90
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,670
And then after doing that, the app should look just like before.

91
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,270
Well, for some reason it isn't.

92
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,060
But let's see that in a minute.

93
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,010
For now, I will just take this component here actually back to the top.

94
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,370
So just here.

95
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,410
Now let's open up our console.

96
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,470
Maybe we have some errors here that we're not catching.

97
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,400
But.

98
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,750
Well, actually, no.

99
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,520
Ah, but I think I know.

100
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,520
And the reason is that here we are not returning.

101
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,810
So we were not returning any.

102
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,140
JS.

103
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,940
And so then of course we couldn't have any JS here in the UI.

104
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,960
Great.

105
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,910
So let's keep going and let's look again at our nav bar.

106
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:13,110
So our nav bar is now a lot simpler than before, but it's still doing a lot of different things here

107
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:13,930
I would say.

108
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,900
So we are displaying a logo.

109
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,490
We have this input field and we have the number of results here.

110
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:27,420
Now, in a way, all of this does actually belong together because well together they form this nav

111
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:27,920
bar.

112
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,620
So we could definitely argue that this is okay like this.

113
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:36,990
But on the other hand, it still takes some work to actually figure out what this component here is

114
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,030
doing and maybe we even might want to reuse some parts of it.

115
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,530
So, for example, this search bar, which is basically this, we might want to reuse it all over the

116
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:51,300
place in the application, at least if the app grew a bit bigger in the future.

117
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,370
And so let's at least grab this part here and extract it into its own component.

118
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,520
So I'm cutting that.

119
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,290
And then let's create a function.

120
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:09,450
Simply called search, then return that.

121
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,310
And of course, we will then need this state.

122
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,340
And we will want to include that here.

123
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,380
Give it a save.

124
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,690
And then it looks exactly like before.

125
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,100
Okay.

126
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:30,880
But now something happened here that I personally really don't like, which is to have one piece of

127
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:37,160
JSX which mixes like this native HTML elements with our custom components.

128
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:42,520
So we have this div, we have this P, but then in the middle we have like our own search.

129
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,990
So that I think looks really ugly and I really don't like that.

130
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,700
I think it's quite confusing.

131
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:53,470
And so let's actually also extract the logo and the Num results.

132
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:58,810
And so then we make this component here really nice and clean and end up with these three components

133
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,140
here where each of them has its own responsibility.

134
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,180
So let's create the logo.

135
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,160
So we will end up here with a few small and reusable components if we'd like.

136
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:20,340
So we have our logo and then let's say num results.

137
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,770
Function.

138
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,790
Num results.

139
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,220
No.

140
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:29,860
Right.

141
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,900
This doesn't look quite correct.

142
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,700
And yeah, now all we have to do is to include them here.

143
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:45,930
And then numb results and this looks a lot nicer.

144
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:52,740
So as soon as we look at our navbar component, we can immediately see, oh, it contains a logo, a

145
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,140
search and the numb results.

146
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:00,480
And from there, if we were interested, we could then really drill down into each of these components

147
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
if we needed to.

148
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,460
And of course, if we wanted, we could even keep going.

149
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:12,510
So we could now create like one component here for the icon and one for the title, so to say.

150
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:18,720
But that would then be that situation in which we would end up with like hundreds of mini components,

151
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,690
which really isn't worth it.

152
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,950
So this is more than enough.

153
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:30,030
This logo is doing just one thing, so it has one responsibility already, which is basically to display

154
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,940
this logo, which is all this.

155
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,990
So there's absolutely no need to break it down even further.

156
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,350
So this is perfect.

157
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,170
Like this.

158
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:42,060
So the nav bar is now finished and we are ready to break up.

159
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,240
The main component, of course, a lot more as well.

160
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,770
So looking at our first criterion, which is the logical separation of content, we clearly have no

161
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,300
clear separation right now.

162
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:57,270
So we have one component that has all of this.

163
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:03,990
And so the first visual division that I would make here is to create one component for this box and

164
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,300
one for the right one here.

165
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,630
And so let's do just that.

166
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,010
Take this box.

167
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,390
Then let's move down here and create.

168
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,290
The list box.

169
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,110
All right.

170
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,150
And I'm calling it the list box.

171
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,590
And now we can see.

172
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,280
So again, I'm calling this component here, the list box, because in there is where we will have this

173
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,840
list of movies here.

174
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,740
So let's now grab the state that is missing here.

175
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,490
So set open one and the movies.

176
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,450
So.

177
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,270
Cutting that from here and placing it here.

178
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,080
All right.

179
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:02,290
Now, of course, when you build your own apps in the future, then you will not build one huge component

180
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,100
like this.

181
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:07,180
This is just an exercise so that we can apply what we learned before.

182
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:13,870
But again, never built such a huge component like this because there's really no need to then have

183
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,810
all the work of splitting that huge component up like we are doing right now.

184
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,490
But I think that yeah, for learning this is fun and absolutely no problem.

185
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,300
So let's grab this other box as well and place it into the watched box.

186
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,540
So function watched.

187
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,130
Box.

188
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,190
All right.

189
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,880
Let's grab all the state that we need here.

190
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:48,630
And let's also already include both the boxes here.

191
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,770
So that's the list box and the watched box.

192
00:12:54,550 --> 00:13:00,670
So basically exactly the code that we had here before now split up into these two components.

193
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,190
Placing the state there and it's not appearing.

194
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,570
But that's because, once again, I'll forgot to return here.

195
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,580
Nice.

196
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,920
So let's keep going, because I still think that this is way too big.

197
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,840
So just looking at this code, it looks quite confusing.

198
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:25,710
You cannot immediately understand what this component here is doing.

199
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,600
It has like this button here which does something, and then we have all of this code down here.

200
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:38,140
And so now what I want to do is to extract this code here into its own list component, which will then

201
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:44,260
have only one responsibility, which is to simply display, well, the list of movies.

202
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,740
So let's grab this.

203
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,600
Cut it from here.

204
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,560
And place it right here.

205
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,350
So movie list.

206
00:13:57,930 --> 00:13:58,920
And keep.

207
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,260
Forgetting to return.

208
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,310
And then here we also need that movies state.

209
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,230
And yeah, here.

210
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:16,120
Then all we need to do is to include that movie list.

211
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,270
Nice.

212
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,920
And this is still working.

213
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,360
Yes.

214
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,760
And so we're doing a great job here.

215
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,470
So this component is now a lot easier to understand here, if you ask me.

216
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:34,410
So we have one button, and then if that button is open, we show the movie list.

217
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,900
Nice.

218
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,840
So getting better and better.

219
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:44,660
And I just want to mention that in the real world, we would probably have one file for each of these

220
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,500
components.

221
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:52,100
So something I said already many times ago or many times before, but I still wanted to just mention

222
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,730
that here.

223
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,150
So we now have this movie list component right here.

224
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,290
And for many people, this would now be enough.

225
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:08,470
But if it comes down to my personal coding style or my personal preference, I would actually like to

226
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:13,150
still extract this list element here into its own movie.

227
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:19,330
And we have actually done that many times before already in this application where we had one component

228
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:26,470
for the list which would then simply loop over some array and then display one component for each element.

229
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:28,990
And so now I will do exactly the same here.

230
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,510
So again, this is now a bit more of my personal preference, but I think that it's actually quite a

231
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:41,570
sensible thing to do because then here we have a the mapping over the array here, isolated in this

232
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:48,050
one component and have then one component which is really only about the movie and nothing else.

233
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,730
And again, I keep forgetting to return here.

234
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,330
And yeah, let's then use that movie here.

235
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,810
And what will happen is that we will pass the current movie.

236
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:08,600
So this one here that's coming from the map as a prop into that component.

237
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,870
We will also need this key no longer here, but now here.

238
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,570
And finally accept that prop.

239
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,080
Right here.

240
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,320
We give it a save?

241
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,610
We have no error.

242
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,500
And so let's keep going.

243
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:29,820
So I think we are quite finished here with this left part.

244
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,980
And so let's go over here.

245
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:38,430
Now, here we can already see that it's a bit more complex because here we have not only the list,

246
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:44,490
but also like this summary of the list, but let's see what we actually have there.

247
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:47,460
So it's inside this watched box.

248
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:54,930
And of course, we can also start seeing our components tree right here, which is always nice.

249
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,480
So I always like to do that actually.

250
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,260
And so it's coming together here quite nicely.

251
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,530
Maybe it doesn't even have to be this big.

252
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,410
Then we can see a bit better.

253
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:12,950
And so, yeah, this is exactly what we have been building.

254
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:18,380
And now all we have to do is to also break up this watched box a bit better.

255
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:21,180
So let's take care of that.

256
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:26,350
And first up, I will do that division that I just mentioned earlier.

257
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:29,710
So we have this list here and also this summary.

258
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,550
So let's grab that summary here.

259
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,080
And so that's basically this div with the class name of summary.

260
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,830
So I'm cutting that and then let's just create.

261
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:44,420
Function.

262
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,900
Watched summary.

263
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,340
And then returning this.

264
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,520
So now this code here actually depends on a few things.

265
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,180
So all of these variables.

266
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,780
So let's see what they are.

267
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,610
So that's these variables right here, plus the West.

268
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,920
Now, we could pass all of these three here individually or actually the four of them.

269
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,480
So what plus these three here?

270
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,300
So we could pass them in.

271
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,720
Into the.

272
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:23,890
Watched box component that we just created.

273
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:29,620
But actually, if we take a look at them, all of them simply depend on the watched state.

274
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:35,960
And so what we're going to do is to grab this and pass this watched list.

275
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,740
So that array right here as a prop.

276
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,860
Okay.

277
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:44,920
Moving there.

278
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:47,100
Pasting that here.

279
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,930
Oh, and of course, we need to accept that Prop ten here.

280
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,260
And now React is happy again.

281
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:03,770
So again, what we did is that these three pieces here are derived state and they are derived from this

282
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,390
watched array right here.

283
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:12,590
And so we simply passed the watched array into this component and then, yeah, just moved these three

284
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:12,980
here.

285
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,140
Of course, also into this component.

286
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:20,570
And so we did that instead of leaving this here in the parent component and passing all of them one

287
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:21,220
by one.

288
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:24,850
But this code here clearly belongs in this component.

289
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:31,370
So it's clearly part of the responsibility of what summary to calculate its own statistics.

290
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:38,570
And if all it needs to do that is this watched array, well then we are happy to provide it with exactly

291
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:39,320
that array.

292
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:45,650
But moving on, let's now create another list which is here for this watched.

293
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,860
So this watched movies list.

294
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,660
So cut that as well.

295
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:58,430
So let's call this one here, the watch list.

296
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:02,800
And of course, we could have also called it the watched movie list.

297
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,340
And let's actually do that.

298
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,160
So remember how I said that we should not be afraid of long component names?

299
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:14,400
And so I think that this is a bit better, actually.

300
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:17,910
Now here we will need that watched array.

301
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,670
So that piece of state that we have up here.

302
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,430
Right.

303
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,520
But let's first give it a save and then see that error.

304
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:30,960
And.

305
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,300
Well, nothing really happened here.

306
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:36,280
Uh.

307
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:44,010
Well, first of all, we have a bug here and it's a big one, which is that we are here, including

308
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:46,380
the same component inside itself.

309
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,800
So we are including Watchbox inside Watchbox.

310
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,420
So this was by mistake.

311
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,990
Probably you have noticed this as I was typing.

312
00:20:54,990 --> 00:21:00,330
So here of course it needs to be the watched summary which is the component that we were talking about

313
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:00,990
before.

314
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,430
But still nothing is happening.

315
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,870
So let's try to reload here.

316
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,990
But now we have like this infinite loop.

317
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,060
Maybe we have some errors.

318
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:20,120
But yeah, I think the best thing to do is to actually quit the application altogether and then just

319
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,380
try to restart.

320
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,370
So let's wait for it.

321
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,550
And.

322
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:27,610
Yeah.

323
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,140
Let's close the old one.

324
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,410
And now we get that error that we had before.

325
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,880
So before I fix that.

326
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,120
Or actually, let's pass it in already here.

327
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:49,660
But still wanted to say that it's really, really important that you do not call the component inside

328
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,650
of itself.

329
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:54,850
So again, I was calling watched box in here.

330
00:21:54,850 --> 00:22:00,220
And so the problem was that this then created an infinite loop of the component calling itself.

331
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:06,160
And so that's why when I was reloading the application react here wasn't really reacting.

332
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,120
So the application wasn't really able to then render itself.

333
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:16,240
And again, because of that infinite loop, so never do what I just did here by mistake.

334
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:23,200
But anyway, we now past the watched array here into this watched movies list.

335
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,580
And so here we just need to receive that.

336
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:31,580
Give it a save and then we are back to normal.

337
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:35,360
Let's quickly get our console back.

338
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:42,070
And, uh, yeah, So this is the list that we have.

339
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,430
And now just one more component where just like before, I will extract the list item into its own component.

340
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,500
So grabbing all of this.

341
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,380
Let's create the watched movie.

342
00:22:58,330 --> 00:22:58,660
Here.

343
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,420
We already know that we need to accept the movie.

344
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:07,810
And here remember, it's very important that we place the prop name into these curly braces because

345
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,860
we are in fact, just destructuring the props object.

346
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,390
Right?

347
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,630
And so then here all we have to do is to write.

348
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,640
What movie pass in the.

349
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,340
Movie prop.

350
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,450
And yeah, we also need this key right here.

351
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,230
And with this we should be done.

352
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,830
And we are indeed.

353
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:39,170
So the app works and looks just like before.

354
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:43,760
But we now divided this application into its logical components.

355
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,930
So components that have a logical separation of the content that might be reusable and that have the

356
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:55,100
right number of responsibilities and of complexity.
