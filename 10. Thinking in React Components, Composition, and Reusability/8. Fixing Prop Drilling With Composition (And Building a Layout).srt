1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:08,500
So let's now use component composition in order to fix the prop drilling problem that we have just encountered

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,220
before.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:17,140
And in the process, we will also find a way better solution to building layouts in React applications.

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:24,880
And let's start by fixing the easy prop drilling problem, which is the one where we pass the movie's

5
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,830
prop into the nav bar.

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,150
And then from the nav bar we pass it here into the numb results.

7
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:34,900
So here we only have one level of prop drilling.

8
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:41,410
Now you might be wondering how can we use component composition in order to solve this problem?

9
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:49,540
Well, what if we could use the numb results component right here in the app component instead of in

10
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:50,440
the nav bar?

11
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:54,910
Then we wouldn't have to pass in this movie's prop into the nav bar.

12
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,690
Right.

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,290
Which would then fix that prop drilling problem.

14
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:03,790
So we can actually do that with component composition.

15
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,570
So let me show you how.

16
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:09,760
So here, instead of accepting the movies, let's accept.

17
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,580
Children.

18
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,400
And so this is then that empty slot that we talked about in the previous lecture.

19
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:24,300
And so now here in the nav bar, instead of closing it right here, let's have a opening tag and a closing

20
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:24,900
tag.

21
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,670
And then between these two we can just grab this.

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:38,440
Police that here and then just include those children and that's it, actually.

23
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,000
So give it a save.

24
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:46,360
The app looks exactly the same as before, but we have eliminated the prop drilling problem.

25
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,170
Right.

26
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:53,790
Because now we are using Num results right here in the component where the state actually lives.

27
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,070
So the movie's state in this case.

28
00:01:56,080 --> 00:02:02,890
And so then we can pass it directly into the component right here, which is the one that actually needs

29
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,360
it.

30
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:09,160
So Num results is not an intermediary component, just like NAV Bar was before.

31
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:15,650
And so, of course then here we can finally and terminally remove it.

32
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:22,250
And so this then really shows that the prop drilling has been eliminated and all by using component

33
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:29,270
composition where we now basically composed the nav bar together with these three other components here.

34
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:34,110
So these three is what are becoming the children of the nav bar.

35
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:39,080
And so here again, we then accept those children and simply display them here.

36
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:46,720
We could also say, for example, that we do not need to display or to include the logo right here.

37
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,920
So we could, for example, cut it here and place it here.

38
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:55,270
And then it works just exactly the same as before.

39
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,780
So this logo here is just completely stateless anyway, and it's not really relevant to the app.

40
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:08,380
And so we could say that it should always be a part of the nav bar, but maybe these two here can be

41
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,190
optional.

42
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:17,050
So with this, we can very easily later say that, well, maybe we don't need a search here, so remove

43
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,060
it and there you go.

44
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,910
We didn't even have to touch the nav bar at all.

45
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:29,380
All we had to do was to come into our application where we now have an easier way of seeing basically

46
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,990
the overall layout of the application.

47
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:40,160
Let's, of course, put it back and then let's fix the worst problem of prop drilling that we also have,

48
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,610
which is here for this movie's list.

49
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,990
So let's do the same with the main component here.

50
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,340
And here remember that we actually need to pass the movie's prop through several layers.

51
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:05,470
So we pass it from app into main into here the list box and so we can remove again all these intermediary

52
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,190
steps.

53
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:14,020
So here in the main, let's no longer accept the movies and instead accept children.

54
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:22,570
So then let's remove the watch box from here or actually the list box or actually, why not Both of

55
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,110
them.

56
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,060
So let's cut them from here.

57
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,930
Say children, and then we can do the same thing as before.

58
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:33,780
So here.

59
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,490
Now we get rid of this.

60
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:45,080
Let's close it and then just place these two here and we can then no longer pass the movies.

61
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:51,540
Into the main element or the main component because that one no longer needs it.

62
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,430
I mean, as you know, it never even needed it in the first place.

63
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,640
It only needed it to pass it further down the tree.

64
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,300
But now that tree is basically built in a different way.

65
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,740
And so then again, this component no longer needs that prop.

66
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,290
Nice.

67
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,930
And so actually we can keep going.

68
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:18,200
So we can just do exactly the same thing here to the list box, because that list box also doesn't need

69
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,220
the movies, really.

70
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,650
It's also just passing it down.

71
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,570
And so let's remove it.

72
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,390
So let's grab this.

73
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,100
Cut it from here.

74
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,180
So this will now become the empty slot here inside this list.

75
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,230
Box component.

76
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,810
So remove that.

77
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,970
Do the same thing as before.

78
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,890
Of course.

79
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,120
We need to close it here.

80
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,540
And while that's taking a bit too long, let's manually reload here.

81
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,640
And still that's not working.

82
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,180
But the code should be correct.

83
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,470
Let me just remove this from here now, and I will simply.

84
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,590
A close the app and run it again.

85
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:13,910
So it's the second time we needed to do this in this section so far.

86
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,720
But sometimes that can happen.

87
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,570
Well, apparently this is not the solution this time.

88
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:22,300
So let's see if we have some error here.

89
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,900
And actually, yeah, sometimes it's a good idea.

90
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:31,270
As I said, right in the beginning of the course to actually read the errors here.

91
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,590
So it says objects are not valid as a react child.

92
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:44,500
So let's go back to our movie list or to the list box, actually, which is the one that we just did

93
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,310
something in.

94
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,410
And yeah, the problem is actually right here.

95
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,980
So here we were basically creating a new object, which is not necessary.

96
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,920
All we need to do here is to really conditionally render this children prop.

97
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,510
So give it a save.

98
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,960
And there we go.

99
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:07,320
Just reload again to get rid of the errors and that's it.

100
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:15,550
So now we are essentially directly passing the movie's prop right here into the movie's list from the

101
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:16,540
app component.

102
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,890
So as I just said, we are in the app component.

103
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:27,970
And now thanks to all this composition here, we can pass the movies directly into the movies list,

104
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,840
which is in fact the only component that does actually need it.

105
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,200
Not this one, not this one, but only this one.

106
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,840
And of course, also this one.

107
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,240
Great.

108
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:45,280
So this is actually a really, really nice way of building layouts in React applications.

109
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,870
So just by looking at the return JSX from the app component, we can nicely see the entire layout and

110
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,480
also basically the entire component tree.

111
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:01,940
So what we have here is indeed very similar to what we can observe right here.

112
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:07,910
So we have the app which has the nav bar, which in turn has the search and numb results and we have

113
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:14,180
the main which has the list box, it has the watched box, and then that one also has some stuff in

114
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:14,720
it.

115
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,750
So here we didn't do the component composition yet, but we will do very soon.

116
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:25,790
For now, I want to take a break here and I want you to analyze this code on your own for a few minutes.

117
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:31,760
So really understand the deep difference between the code that we had before and the code that we have

118
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:32,540
right now.

119
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:39,530
And if necessary, you can also rewatch the previous lecture in which I explained exactly what is happening

120
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,250
as well.

121
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:46,760
So again, please take now 5 or 10 minutes to do that and then let's move on to the next video.
