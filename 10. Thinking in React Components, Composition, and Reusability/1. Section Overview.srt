00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,930
Welcome to the second section on how to think in React.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:14,300
This time we'll learn how to think about components, component composition, and component reusability.

3
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:20,890
So we're going to build this beautiful new project over the next few sections.

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:28,880
In this section, we lay the foundation of the project by learning deeply about how to split a user

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:36,740
interface into components, what type of components we can use, and then how to implement it all in

6
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,610
React.

7
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:46,310
We'll also build a simple app layout for the first time using the power of composition, and all these

8
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:54,200
are already intermediate react topics, but still absolutely fundamental for any React developer.

9
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:59,030
So if that sounds like fun, then let's get started.
