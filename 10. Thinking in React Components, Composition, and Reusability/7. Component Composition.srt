00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,440
As we keep learning about components in this section, there is one essential principle that we really

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,760
need to focus on now, which is component composition.

3
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:20,480
Now, in order to talk about component composition, we first need to take a look at what happens when

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,840
we simply use or include a component in another component in X.

5
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:34,700
So let's say that we have this modal component that we want to reuse and also this success component

6
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,550
which simply renders the message well done.

7
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:44,150
And then we just use the success component inside the modal component like this.

8
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,880
And this sort of thing is exactly what we have been doing with our components.

9
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:51,470
Most of the time.

10
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,340
Right.

11
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,360
So we just use them inside of other components.

12
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:02,140
However, when it comes to reusability, this creates a big problem.

13
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:09,340
That's because right now the success component really is inside of modal.

14
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,390
They are deeply linked together in the JSX right now.

15
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:20,800
And therefore, we cannot reuse this modal component to display some other message inside of it, for

16
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,570
example, an error message.

17
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:30,550
But as you can imagine, in order to solve this, we now bring in the technique of component composition,

18
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:35,320
where we can compose the modal and success components together.

19
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:42,130
So here we have our modal component again, but with a fundamental difference.

20
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:50,440
So this component does not include a predefined component, but instead it accepts children with the

21
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,550
children prop.

22
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,280
So just like we have learned before.

23
00:01:54,580 --> 00:02:02,800
So if we get our success component again, we can now basically just pass it into the modal by placing

24
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,170
it between the opening and closing tags when we use modal.

25
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:13,000
And if you need a minute to analyze this code a bit better, feel free to just pause the video right

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,550
now because I want you to really grasp the fundamental difference here.

27
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:27,010
So in the first example, the success component is really tight to the modal, and so that modal might

28
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:33,780
as well be called a success modal because we can't use it for anything else anymore.

29
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:41,170
But with component composition, we simply passed the success component right into the modal and compose

30
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,180
them together in this way.

31
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,440
And again, this works thanks to the children prop.

32
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,960
Now, of course, we could have passed in any other component, which makes the modal component highly

33
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,980
reusable.

34
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:05,070
So essentially when we do component composition, we leave this hole or this empty slot in the component

35
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:09,390
ready to be filled with any other component that we want.

36
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:17,290
So let's say that later we needed another modal window somewhere else in the app, but one that renders

37
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,910
this error message.

38
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,190
Well, that's pretty easy.

39
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:29,080
Now we just use the modal component again, but this time we pass in the error component as a children

40
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,960
and with this we have also successfully composed these two components together as well.

41
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:43,030
So formally, component composition is the technique of combining different components by using the

42
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:48,190
children prop or by explicitly defining components as props.

43
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:54,550
Now we use composition for two big reasons or in two important situations.

44
00:03:54,670 --> 00:04:02,890
First, when we want to create highly reusable and flexible components such as the modal window or really

45
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,730
a million other reusable components that we can think of.

46
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,670
And we do this really all the time.

47
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:17,370
Now, the second situation in which we can use composition is in order to fix a prop drilling problem

48
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:20,780
like the one that we found in the previous video.

49
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:27,180
And this is actually great for creating layouts as we will do in the next video.

50
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:34,860
Just keep in mind once again that this is only possible because components do not need to know their

51
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:42,690
children in advance, which allows us to leave these empty slots inside of them in the form of the children

52
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,320
prop.

53
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:47,610
And with that being said, let's return to our project.
