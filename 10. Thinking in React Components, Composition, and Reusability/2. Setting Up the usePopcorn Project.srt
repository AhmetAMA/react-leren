1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:04,250
It's time to set up our next project.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:10,930
So we're building a lot of projects here, which is exactly what you need to become the react developer

3
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,370
that you want to be.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,290
And by now you already know the drill.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:23,100
So just fire up your terminal or your command prompt if you are on windows and then simply navigate

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,090
to the folder that you want to build your next project in.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:34,500
Then type Npx, create React app at version number five, please.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,150
And then the name of the app which is Use Popcorn.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,570
So what might that be?

10
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,010
That's a bit of a strange name.

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,400
So let's actually check it out right now.

12
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,030
So this is the use popcorn app.

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:58,110
And if you want, you can go explore it right now on your own at use Popcorn dot Netlify dot app.

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,040
So it's called use popcorn because this application is all about movies.

15
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:11,120
And maybe you see that this prefix here of the name is this keyword of use and that reminds you maybe

16
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,130
of the use state name.

17
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,190
So the name of the use state hook.

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:22,490
And so that's because we will build this project over this section and even to other sections and it

19
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,340
is going to be all about hooks, basically.

20
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,850
And so that's a hint to that here, right in the name.

21
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,130
But anyway, here in the search bar, we can now search for movies.

22
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,420
So let's say one of my all time favorite movies called Inception.

23
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:44,160
And this is now loading these movies here from a real API.

24
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,890
So we're doing some real data fetching here.

25
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:53,520
Then we can click on any of these movies which will then take us to this display overview here.

26
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,470
Then we can rate the movie.

27
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:00,690
So you see that we have this nice rating component and this one is definitely a ten.

28
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,390
Then it asks us if we want to add the movie to our watch list.

29
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,160
And as we say, yes.

30
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:11,660
Then you see that the movie has indeed been added to our watch list here.

31
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,940
Let's say we also saw this one here.

32
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,680
Maybe it was a seven.

33
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,830
Then let's also add it to our list.

34
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,970
And you see now we have both of them.

35
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,020
And up here we have some statistics about our watch list.

36
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,480
We can also delete movies from here.

37
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,270
So maybe later I remembered that I didn't actually watch this one, so let's get rid of it.

38
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,370
And yeah, so another thing is that when we click here.

39
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:41,420
On a movie that we already rated before.

40
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:47,000
Then you see that here it no longer displays that rating component, but our actual rating.

41
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:54,170
Then we can always go back by clicking here, or we can also just hit the escape key.

42
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,410
So that also works.

43
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,190
So that's another small feature right there.

44
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,870
And yeah, that's actually it.

45
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,630
So a very small application, but again, with real data fetching.

46
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,140
So that's going to be something really nice that we're going to do for the first time.

47
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,720
So this app here might feel already a little bit more real because of that.

48
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:20,250
Now, as I said, we will build this throughout three sections.

49
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,820
And so in this first section, we will only work with static data yet.

50
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,190
So this list of movies here is not yet coming from an API.

51
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,510
It's just an array of objects as we have been working with before.

52
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,560
The only thing that works here already is the state here.

53
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:44,970
So we can like collapse these two lists here and we can also already write something here into this

54
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,860
search bar.

55
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,290
But besides that, in this section, we are more concerned about the component part.

56
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:57,810
So basically creating this layout that we see here and also talking a bit about component reusability

57
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,370
and component composition.

58
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,680
And with that being said, let's actually move on to the next lecture where we will learn a bit more

59
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,470
about how to think about components.
