1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:08,080
So with our project now installed, let's start by building the static layout of the application.

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:16,400
And as always, let's start by getting the starter files, which in this case is just this CSS file.

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,510
So of course that we don't have to write any styles or selves.

4
00:00:20,870 --> 00:00:23,450
Then place that here into source.

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:27,560
Now there will already be one, so just replace that.

6
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:33,310
And since we're already here, we can get rid of all the junk that we don't need.

7
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,710
So all of these.

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:42,550
So in the end, we just have App.js, Index.js and index.js.

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,930
Okay, then just renaming this here once again.

10
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:53,000
And then let's drag and drop it onto the VS code icon.

11
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,800
Okay.

12
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:00,950
So here we already have our files.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:06,320
As always, we need to clean this one here because we are importing some files that.

14
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:09,080
We no longer have, basically.

15
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,200
But that's it.

16
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:17,750
And once again, if you feel like it, you can actually delete all of this and write the code yourself

17
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,970
just to practice how we can set up this React app from complete scratch.

18
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:29,450
But I will just leave this here because in the end, when you build your own applications, you will

19
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,200
always just leave this here as well.

20
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:35,180
You're not always going to write everything from scratch.

21
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:39,320
But here I actually want to delete everything and start from scratch.

22
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,620
So export default.

23
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,320
Function.

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,040
Yep.

25
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,790
So this is usually always the same as well here.

26
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:55,400
So you always have your app parent component, which will include all the other components.

27
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,700
And let's actually start with these other components.

28
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,720
So just the components that we talked about in the previous lecture.

29
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,890
So that's a function logo.

30
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:13,960
And now I will just quickly duplicate this code here.

31
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,530
Just to make this a little bit faster.

32
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,720
So packing list.

33
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,730
And then we also have or stats.

34
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:32,940
So these are the four big components that we identified in the last lecture.

35
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,080
Remember that?

36
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:40,370
And so let's now write a little bit of JS for each of them, starting with the logo.

37
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,690
So the logo is many times an image, but in this case we will just have a primary heading.

38
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,120
And we will say far away.

39
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,670
And then let's add some emoji here.

40
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:59,650
Now, the way we write emojis on the Mac is by hitting control command spacebar and on Windows, the

41
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,040
shortcut is Windows plus period.

42
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,960
So like this.

43
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,250
So the windows key.

44
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,020
And then plus this dot.

45
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,270
All right, then.

46
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,820
Here, let's use a palm tree.

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,620
So this one here.

48
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,480
And then a back.

49
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,420
Just like this.

50
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:29,600
And in case you can't get these emojis to work, you can always just copy them from the final files

51
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,740
of this project.

52
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,930
Or you can, of course, just ignore them as well.

53
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:37,160
So these are just to make the design a little bit nicer.

54
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,720
Okay, that's enough for the logo.

55
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,760
So we will just write some very simple starter JS here for each component as we are.

56
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,280
Scaffolding basically this layout.

57
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,890
So here, let's just return a div with the class of ad form.

58
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:06,810
And again, you can of course, explore the CSS file and see all the CSS that I wrote for these class

59
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,330
names that we are going to import here.

60
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:19,040
So in here later, we will have these form elements like the select box, the input box and that button.

61
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,410
But for now we will just write the text.

62
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,050
So what do you need?

63
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,700
For your trip.

64
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,980
And here we also had some emoji.

65
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,600
Let's add that as well.

66
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,880
And it's actually already down here.

67
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,710
Okay.

68
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,020
And notice how Eslint is complaining that we are not using these variables here.

69
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:47,730
But of course we will do that soon by including all of them here in the global parent component.

70
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,260
So here in this app.

71
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,290
But again, let's leave that for later.

72
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,770
So we do that in the end.

73
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,490
For now, we just write the static part of all the components.

74
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,560
And this one is the list.

75
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,670
So again.

76
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,760
Just like a placeholder there.

77
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:15,820
And let's make this one here a footer element.

78
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:20,260
So remember how this stats is really at the bottom of the page.

79
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,930
And so a footer seems like a good fit here.

80
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,950
So.

81
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,040
So let's write.

82
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,180
You have.

83
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,860
And then here in the end, we will have a number.

84
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,920
So let's just use an X for now.

85
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:39,350
Items on your list and you already packed.

86
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,760
And then again an X, which is X percent of the total.

87
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,670
Then here we also had some emoji.

88
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,810
Like this other bag here.

89
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,200
And.

90
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,800
Yeah.

91
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,920
I think this one was also formatted.

92
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,400
Uh, so let's use emphasize here.

93
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,550
So m.

94
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:12,330
And now with that, let's come here to our app component and use all of them here in our layout.

95
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,680
And if you want, you can actually pause the video here and do that as a challenge.

96
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,490
So just create one div element with the class of app and then include the four components in there if

97
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,240
you'd like.

98
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,270
So this is how you do that?

99
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,030
So with the class of EP.

100
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:40,010
And then one by one, one after the other, we just include them here.

101
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,460
So first the logo, then the form.

102
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,840
So actually exactly in the way that we define them in our code.

103
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:52,190
And by the way, in more real apps.

104
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:58,460
And also a bit later in the course, we will start placing each of these components here into one individual

105
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,080
file.

106
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:06,680
So we will then have one file called App.js for this component, one called logo JS for this one and

107
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,930
so on and so forth.

108
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,730
But here, since we are still learning, I think it's easier to build all of them here in the same file

109
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,500
because otherwise we are jumping around all the times through these files.

110
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:24,020
And so that then makes everything a lot more confusing, especially when we get into topics such as

111
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,030
child to parent communication.

112
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,660
But yeah, more about that very soon.

113
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,160
So to finish the stats and that's it.

114
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:40,060
So no component is yellow here anymore.

115
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,880
And so that means that we didn't forget any.

116
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,010
And yeah, with this we are done.

117
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,870
So let's open up our integrated terminal.

118
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:57,140
Like this and we are already in the correct folder, so npm start.

119
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,900
And let's wait for it.

120
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,700
Beautiful.

121
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,990
Well, here, it seems we missed some class.

122
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,390
Let's make this smaller again.

123
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,770
All right.

124
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:24,860
And so this footer here needs the class of stats.

125
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,340
Yeah.

126
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:27,190
Wonderful.

127
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:31,830
So this is what it's supposed to look like, and it looks exactly like our demo.

128
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,810
Well, except, of course, for these details right here, which we will take care of starting in the

129
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:38,710
next lecture.

130
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:46,570
So next up, we will start rendering some static items here so we will not yet dynamically add new items

131
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,880
to the list, but we will render some static items from an array here in the UI.
