1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:05,410
Handling events in React is actually pretty straightforward.

2
00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:07,900
And so let's now learn how it's done.

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:15,580
So as you can imagine, we are not going to use the Add event listener method here because that is the

4
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:18,250
imperative way of building UI's.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:25,150
But here in React, we use a more declarative approach so we do not manually select Dom elements and

6
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,740
so therefore we do also not use add event listener.

7
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,850
Instead, we use something similar to the HTML inline event listener.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,970
So instead in React, we do something very similar to the HTML inline event listener.

9
00:00:40,990 --> 00:00:47,830
So basically we will directly listen for the event right on the element where they will happen.

10
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:56,050
So right here on the button, for example, we can use the onClick prop and then we simply specify a

11
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:56,920
function here.

12
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:04,870
So the click is the event name, and then we always prefix it with the on and then we need to write

13
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,250
it in camel case.

14
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,560
While in inline HTML.

15
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,990
We would write it like this.

16
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,480
So like this and then specifying a string.

17
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,420
So no camelcase.

18
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,190
But this is not HTML, it is JSX.

19
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,350
And so it's slightly different.

20
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,640
Just as we learned before in the lecture about the rules on JSX.

21
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,630
So again, we will pass in here now a function and that function will then be executed whenever there

22
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,960
is a click happening on this Dom element.

23
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,840
So in this case, on this button right here.

24
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:42,860
So let's create a quick arrow function here.

25
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,280
And all I'm going to do now is to alert.

26
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,930
Something.

27
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,540
Let's say previous, and this should already be working.

28
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,370
So if I click here now.

29
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,870
Then yes, we get the alert that is saying previous.

30
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,850
And we can do the same thing on the other button.

31
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,220
And here we say next.

32
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,680
And so, of course, then here we will get a different message.

33
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:15,100
And that's essentially it.

34
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,480
So this is how we handle events.

35
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:24,350
The React way no add event listeners, but instead we specify an event listener function directly on

36
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:30,680
the element using, in this case the onClick prop, but it could be any other event as well.

37
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:33,530
So we can specify another event handler.

38
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,860
So let's use the on mouse enter.

39
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,540
And so now here again, we need to specify a function.

40
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:48,690
And it's really, really important to understand that it is not a function call, but really a function.

41
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,120
So we cannot simply write.

42
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,340
Alert.

43
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:58,370
Test, for example, because watch what happens now as I save.

44
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:05,950
So you see, immediately we got this test right here and not when a hover over the button.

45
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,870
So why is that?

46
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,910
Well, basically, as soon as React initializes this component.

47
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,590
So when it first calls this app function, it will then see this code.

48
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:19,750
And so here we are calling alert.

49
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,140
And so then that's exactly what it does.

50
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:23,620
React will read this code.

51
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,080
And then here it finds this function call.

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,750
And so it will immediately call this function.

53
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,260
But again, that's not what we want.

54
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:37,230
We want to basically define a callback function which will be called at a later time.

55
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:42,690
And that later time is in this case, when the mouse enters this element.

56
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,620
So you see that now?

57
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,410
Nothing happened.

58
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:51,310
But as soon as the mouse hovers here, then this function is called.

59
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,520
So this function is called.

60
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,110
And then we get our alert.

61
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,480
So again, very, very important.

62
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,520
Do not call a function here, but really specify a function value.

63
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,540
Somehow we got that again here.

64
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,190
But never mind.

65
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,630
So this was just a test.

66
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,430
Anyway, let's get rid of this.

67
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:16,110
This was just to show you that we can listen, of course, to more than just the click event.

68
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,370
Now, usually we do not directly define the event handler function right here in the onClick prop,

69
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,260
but instead we create a separate function and then pass that function in here.

70
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,490
So let's do that now.

71
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,620
And so usually we create those event handler functions right here in the component.

72
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,750
So that's something new that we haven't done before, but that's perfectly fine.

73
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,890
We can define any functions that we want.

74
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,640
Here, right inside the component body.

75
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,340
And let's call this one handle.

76
00:04:52,930 --> 00:05:01,060
Previous and this handle part here in the event handler function is pretty standard in react development.

77
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,010
So you will see this all the time.

78
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:10,030
And so then you know immediately that this function is an event handler function that is probably being

79
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,390
used somewhere in the JSX of that component.

80
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:16,690
In this case, it's going to be used right here.

81
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,580
So handle previous and what we want to do here again for now.

82
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,210
It's just to alert previous.

83
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,110
So if we click here now, that's going to work still.

84
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,650
Great.

85
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:41,260
And once again, really, really important to notice that here we are just passing in the function value.

86
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:49,250
So we are not calling it because if we were calling it, then again we would immediately see that previous.

87
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:54,140
So React would then immediately run this code here as it sees it.

88
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:56,720
No.

89
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,390
Right.

90
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,350
But like this, we are only passing in the function.

91
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,930
Or of course we could also do this.

92
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,480
But of course that's very redundant.

93
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,010
So now we are back to just having a function here, right?

94
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,390
It's just a function that calls another one, so that's not very effective.

95
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:20,660
But sometimes we will have to do something similar.

96
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,570
But for now, this is the way that makes sense.

97
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,970
And so let's now quickly create another one.

98
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:31,210
So again, this is usually the way we do it.

99
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:39,330
So creating a function which starts with handle, and then we simply pass that function here into the

100
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:45,300
onClick prop or any other prop that we can use to handle some other event.

101
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:47,220
All right.

102
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,750
Just to make sure that it works.

103
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,430
And indeed it does.

104
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:52,350
Great.

105
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,190
So this is how we handle events typically in React.

106
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:00,270
But of course now we actually want something meaningful to happen here.

107
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:05,940
And in particular, we want to basically change this step value here.

108
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:06,780
Right?

109
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,020
And for that we need something called state.

110
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:16,290
Now, we have touched on state many times already, but now it's time to really learn what state is

111
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,020
and then how we can use it in practice.
