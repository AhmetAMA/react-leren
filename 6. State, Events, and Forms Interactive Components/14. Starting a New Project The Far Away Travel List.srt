00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:07,910
In the second part of this section, let's now build our first project that has some real interactivity.

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,760
And so let's get straight to it.

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,830
And by now you know the drill.

4
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:16,900
So if you're on windows, open up your command prompt.

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,300
If you're on a mac, open your terminal, please.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,970
And then as always, navigate to the folder where you want to create your project.

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,810
So that's my desktop and then in there run NP.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,560
Create react.

9
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:35,830
App.

10
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,580
And then please specify version number five here.

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,920
And then finally, the name of the project, which is going to be travel list.

12
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,740
Then hit, enter and then let create React app, do its thing.

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:56,110
And in the meantime, I will give you a quick tour of the app that we're going to build.

14
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:03,100
So this is the far away app, which is a simple travel list where we can add all the items that we need

15
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,930
for our next trip.

16
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:12,940
So, for example, let's say we need two boarding passes that we really cannot forget, and then we

17
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,980
can hit, enter or click here.

18
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:18,430
And so then that item gets added here to the list.

19
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,500
And also you see that down here we have the statistics that just got updated.

20
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,050
So that's already some interactivity right there.

21
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:29,060
But of course we can do more.

22
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:35,090
So, for example, let's say we don't need the charger anymore for some reason, so we can just click

23
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,130
there and it's gone.

24
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:40,690
We also can mark these items as completed.

25
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,530
So basically as packed.

26
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,740
So let's say we already packed that one and that one.

27
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,760
And then down here it says we already packed two, which is 50%.

28
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,220
But there is even more.

29
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,340
So we can also sort by these three things here.

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:01,670
So input order or by description or by the pact status.

31
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,910
And so then the pact items here, they appear at the end.

32
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:11,750
And finally, maybe once we are back from our trip and want to prepare our next one, we can just clear

33
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,280
the entire list at once.

34
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,160
So it then asks us if we are sure.

35
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,900
And yes, we are.

36
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:22,980
And indeed then our list becomes completely empty and that's it.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,910
So I think this is a really nice little project for us to learn some more interactivity.

38
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,590
And it has all these nice but simple features that we are going to build.

39
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,270
And on top of that, I also really like this nice design here.

40
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:43,820
It's a bit retro, which I think really fits the vibe of this application.

41
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:50,510
And now before we start writing any code, let's actually take a look at how we can break up this entire

42
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,760
design into components.

43
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,400
So this first big yellow part, I think we can call this the logo of the application.

44
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,650
And so we're going to create one component called logo just for this part.

45
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,310
Then next up, we clearly have some form here.

46
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,710
And so that's where we are going to put these elements.

47
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,920
So yet another component.

48
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,370
Next.

49
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:19,930
Then we have this entire list, which I think can be called the packing list.

50
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,120
And then in there, each of these items is well, just called an item.

51
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,770
We could call it a packing item maybe, but we'll see once we get to the code.

52
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,490
Finally, down here, we have this other area which I think we can just call stats or statistics.

53
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,620
So this is how we are going to break up this user interface into components.

54
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,210
And we will talk a lot more about how we actually do this.

55
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,070
So how we arrive at these different components.

56
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,400
But that's not the focus of this application here.

57
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:57,250
We just want to work a little bit more with state, with events and also learn about how we can handle

58
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,480
form submissions.

59
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:05,230
So if that sounds fun, then let's quickly move on to the next lecture and start implementing this layout.
