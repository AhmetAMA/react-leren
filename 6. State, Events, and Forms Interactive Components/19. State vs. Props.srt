00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:06,960
A very common beginner question or sometimes even an interview question is this.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,590
What's the difference between state and props?

3
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:16,260
Well, we actually already learned almost everything to answer that question.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:22,920
But let's still make the difference between state and props crystal clear in this lecture, which will

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,550
also serve as a nice summary to this entire section.

6
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,410
So as we already know, state is internal data.

7
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:36,640
So data that is owned by the component in which it is declared.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,530
And we can see that nicely in this small example with two components.

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:45,550
Now on the other hand, props is external data.

10
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:52,120
So data that is owned by the parent component and you can think of props as function parameters.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:01:00,310
So as a communication channel between parent and child components where parents can pass data into children,

12
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:06,640
State, on the other hand, can be thought of as the components memory because it can hold data over

13
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,240
time.

14
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:13,840
So across multiple rerenders now state can be updated by the component itself.

15
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:19,900
And as we already know, this will then cause the component to be rerendered by react.

16
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,090
Therefore, we use this mechanism of state to make components interactive.

17
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:32,180
On the other side, props work very differently if they are read only, so they cannot be modified by

18
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:34,610
the component that is receiving them.

19
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:41,570
However, and this is something that we haven't learned before when the child component receives new

20
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:46,790
updated props that will actually also cause the component to rerender.

21
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,540
And let's actually analyze that here in this code example.

22
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:58,910
So one of the props that was passed to question is called upvotes, and that upvotes variable is actually

23
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,880
state in the parent component, right?

24
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,850
It's created using the use state hook and therefore upvotes is in fact state.

25
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:14,960
Now if this piece of state is updated, of course the question component who owns the state will be

26
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,830
rerendered.

27
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:23,210
But it makes sense that the child component who basically receives that state as props should also be

28
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:23,990
rerendered.

29
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,770
Right.

30
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:32,390
Because how else would the button component be kept in sync with the state that it received as a prop?

31
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:40,960
So in conclusion, whenever a piece of state is passed as a prop, when that state updates, both components

32
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,270
are re rendered.

33
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,370
So both the component owning the state and the component receiving the state as a prop.

34
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:55,030
And so this is a very important connection between state and props that you should keep in mind.

35
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:02,740
Now finally, while state is used by developers to make components, interactive props are used to give

36
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:07,390
the parent component the ability to configure their child components.

37
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:15,040
So basically, props can be seen as settings in child components, which the parent component can define

38
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,210
as they wish.

39
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,430
And that's it.

40
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:25,300
So if you ever get asked the difference between state and props in a job interview, I sure hope that

41
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,740
you are going to nail it.
