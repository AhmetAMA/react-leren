1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:08,750
As web developers, we rely a lot on developer tools, so things like the console or the element inspect

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,720
panel in our browser.

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:19,130
And so since tools are so helpful for developers, the React team built dev tools specific for React,

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,050
which can be extremely helpful when working with state.

5
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,960
And so since we're working with State now, let's go check them out.

6
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:34,630
And actually since the beginning, we got this message here in our console telling us to download these

7
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:41,890
dev tools so you can open up your console and then here you will find the link to the place in the React

8
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,570
documentation where we then can find the link to the dev tools.

9
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,290
So here is the link for the Chrome Web store and then for the other browsers.

10
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,970
But since we're using Google Chrome, this is the one that we want.

11
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:05,550
And if for some reason this link here didn't appear in your console, you can just Google Chrome react.

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,900
Dev tools.

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,060
So that's going to be this first one.

14
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,220
And so then once you're on this page.

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,030
Or on this one, we're just the same.

16
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:21,970
You can just download this extension and install it in your Google Chrome.

17
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,810
Now, I cannot do this because I'm on a guest window, so let me quickly fix that.

18
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,940
And so now here in this window, I can actually use these dev tools as well.

19
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,450
So hopefully you installed the tool.

20
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:42,090
So just like any other Chrome extension and then once you did down here, once you have these developer

21
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:49,710
tools here already open, you will see one tab which appears here or actually two which are coming from

22
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,060
the React dev tools.

23
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,390
So that's this component tab and this profiler tab.

24
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,020
And since we're going to use this all the time, we can even drag.

25
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,760
Well, actually not.

26
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:00,980
Yeah.

27
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:06,050
Now we can, like, drag it here to the beginning where it will then stay.

28
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,820
Now, here it says Loading, react element tree, which should be fast.

29
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,440
So let's try that again.

30
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:17,990
And actually it only worked for me after closing and reopening my browser.

31
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:24,800
So if you see the same error message that I had previously down here, then please go ahead and do the

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,540
same now.

33
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,650
But so now everything is working.

34
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:35,300
And so let's take a look at these dev tools and in particular of this component part of the dev tools,

35
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,840
because again, there's another part which is this profiler.

36
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,060
But we will come back to that a bit later.

37
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:47,690
So components basically, as the name says, is for showing a component tree.

38
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:48,990
Now.

39
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:53,340
Right now we only have one component, so only the app component.

40
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,880
And so then this is the only one that we can see here.

41
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:03,060
But if we had more, then all of them would be showing up down here and we could see our entire component

42
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,630
tree.

43
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,750
So I will show you this again once we have that.

44
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:13,290
The point here now is that we can take a look at all the state that is inside each component.

45
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,610
To make this even a bit bigger here so you can actually see.

46
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,660
Well, that's maybe too big or.

47
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,700
I can also make the entire window bigger.

48
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,140
So just like this.

49
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,740
So you see here that first we have this props, which is for all the props that the component that is

50
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,140
currently selected is receiving.

51
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,530
And in this case, we of course, are receiving no props.

52
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,790
So nothing there.

53
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:43,920
But then here is the interesting part.

54
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,890
So here we then have a list of all the hooks.

55
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:52,250
And so here we have these two entries, one for each state hook that we used.

56
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:56,400
So remember that we created the state with use state.

57
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,460
And these use functions are hooks.

58
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,640
Therefore they are here in the list of hooks.

59
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:09,330
But anyway, what's interesting is that we can now manipulate these values down here to experiment with

60
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:09,840
them.

61
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:17,240
For example, when we have a Boolean value, we here get this checkbox and so then we can toggle it,

62
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,940
which will then also toggle the value here.

63
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,590
So from true to false.

64
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,470
So basically we can do the same thing as in the UI, but here with the dev tools.

65
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:34,370
And so that's very useful and it's a bit similar to what we also can do with CSS here in the element

66
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:34,820
tab.

67
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,340
So here we can do similar things.

68
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,740
So this was inspired by that.

69
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:43,130
And then of course here we can also change this state.

70
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:51,800
So we can go from 1 to 3 directly or of course we can also try with values that we usually cannot access

71
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,910
from the UI.

72
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,400
So by clicking these buttons, we cannot set the state to ten, for example.

73
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,880
But maybe for some reason we need to see what the UI looks like with ten, and so then we can come here

74
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,700
to the dev tools and set it to this.

75
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:10,490
Now again, this is just a small demo example.

76
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,230
So here that wouldn't be important.

77
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:17,780
But in bigger and large scale applications, this might be necessary from time to time.

78
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:24,180
And so this is very, very important to keep in mind that you can use the dev tools for this kind of

79
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,720
thing.

80
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:27,350
So that's one thing.

81
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:33,680
And as I mentioned earlier, it's also very useful to be able to see the entire component tree right

82
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:40,340
here, because when we have many, many files in a project and dozens or even hundreds of components

83
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:46,430
in our app, maybe then it can become quickly out of hand and we can lose sight of which components

84
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,090
are aware.

85
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,270
And so then a component tree can become very handy.

86
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:54,650
So instead of drawing that manually, we just come here and there it is.

87
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,480
Okay.

88
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,410
And that's for now.

89
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,110
All I had to tell you about these dev tools.

90
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,070
Very handy.

91
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:06,860
Make sure that you install them and we will come back to them in future lectures for sure.
