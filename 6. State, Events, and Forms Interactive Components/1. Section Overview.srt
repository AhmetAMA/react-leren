00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,180
Welcome to the next section.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:11,220
In this one, we will keep exploring fundamental react topics and finally make our components do something

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:14,640
so we will make components interactive now.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,980
So to do that, we will start learning how to handle events in React and how to update the user interface

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,240
using the extremely important concept of state.

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:34,890
We'll also start building our next project where we're going to focus on state and on building forms

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,700
in the React way using controlled elements.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:45,600
By the end of the section, we'll summarize everything we have learned about props and state, both

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,560
in theory and in practice by building a really nice small flashcards application.

10
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,110
So once again, a super essential and foundational section for you.

11
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,910
And so let's move on right away by.
