1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,400
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:09,740
So now that we know that we want to use Create, React app for small course projects, let's actually

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,810
set up our very first project.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,170
Now with the Create React App tool.

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:20,760
Now Create React app is a command line interface tool.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,610
And so now we need actually a terminal or a command prompt as it's called, on windows.

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,930
So if you're on Windows, go ahead and open up your command prompt.

8
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,280
And if you're on a mac, then open up your terminal.

9
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,110
Okay, let's make this a bit bigger.

10
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,490
And there's not a lot of things that you need to know about the terminal.

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:51,270
So all you need to know is that in the terminal or also in the command prompt, which I'm just going

12
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,360
to use interchangeably, you're always in a folder and that folder is usually displayed here in the

13
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,560
command prompt.

14
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,870
Now this command prompt here.

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,120
So this thing probably looks very different for you than it looks for me, but that's just because I

16
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:09,480
have this kind of extension here installed.

17
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,790
So for you, it's probably just all black.

18
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,900
And most likely you will see the folder that you're currently in here.

19
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:21,480
So I'm currently in this folder, which is basically just the home folder and you can see the contents

20
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:23,880
of the folder by writing.

21
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,830
LS on the Mac.

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,530
And on windows.

23
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:31,030
The same thing is Der, which stands for directory.

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,180
So again, with this you can see the contents of the current directory.

25
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:42,080
So what I want to do now is to navigate to another directory, which is where I ultimately want to run

26
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,330
the Create React app tool.

27
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,120
So for me that's the desktop again.

28
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,990
And so I can write CD and then the name of the folder and hit enter.

29
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,720
And this command is actually the exact same on Windows.

30
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,830
So that's also CD.

31
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,140
And so make sure that you navigate to the folder in which you want to create the new project.

32
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:09,080
So again, for me, that's on the desktop and just to make sure these are the two folders that are on

33
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,710
my desktop, which are exactly these two, right.

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,380
Now, later on we will actually use the terminal that is integrated into VS code, for example, to

35
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,330
start and stop the application.

36
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:27,330
But to create an application, we will always keep using this terminal here because the terminal that's

37
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,320
in VS code is usually tied to the project folder itself.

38
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,850
But here we don't have a project folder yet.

39
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,980
Instead we will now create it using create React app.

40
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:48,000
Once you're in the folder where you want to create the new project, type NP and then create React app

41
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,330
and then the name of the app that you want to build.

42
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:59,840
Now, in our case, that's going to be pizza dash menu because this is our very first project that we're

43
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,660
going to build in this course in the next section.

44
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:10,250
However, we're not really ready to run this yet because I want you to actually use the version five

45
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,990
of Create React app.

46
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:19,340
So please write this at and then five to lock in version five of Create React app.

47
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:25,490
And that's important because this tool will most likely change in the future and then it might work

48
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,910
in a slightly different way than the one that I'm showing you here.

49
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:34,820
But in order not to run into any problems, let's just fix this on version five for the rest of the

50
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,480
course.

51
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:40,670
And then later, if you want to build your own projects outside of the course, you of course no longer

52
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,540
need this.

53
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,710
Then you will just run, create, React app like this without the version number.

54
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,530
But here, let's do it like this.

55
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:55,500
So once you have it written like this, just hit enter and this will then take a long time to download.

56
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:03,990
Well actually, first it asks me if I want to proceed, so just type Y and then enter or return.

57
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:11,790
And so yeah, now it is starting to download like thousands of packages, which will take a lot of time,

58
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:17,190
but you see it already created the folder with the name of the app that we specified here.

59
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,420
So Pizza menu.

60
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:24,780
So go ahead and pause the video right now and I will be back here once downloading all of these packages

61
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,890
has finished.

62
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:27,920
Okay.

63
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,170
And it's done installing all the packages.

64
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:35,510
And so now we can actually close up this terminal or the command prompt.

65
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,000
Now, before I open up this folder here, I will quickly rename this folder just so they stay in the

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,530
order that I want them to be.

67
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,630
But this is totally optional.

68
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:49,200
So number two will be for the next section.

69
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,240
That's why this one is number three.

70
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,540
Okay.

71
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,460
And now we're ready to open up this project as our project folder in vs code.

72
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,190
So once again, I will drag and drop it onto the VS code icon down here.

73
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:11,440
Or optionally, you can also just open a new vs code window and then open up the project folder right

74
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:11,980
here.

75
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:19,630
But anyway, let's now explore the file structure that has been created for us by Create React App.

76
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:27,370
And we can already see that this is actually just a regular NPM project that we could also have manually

77
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,610
created using the NPM init command.

78
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:38,680
So we have a package.json file here which contains the name of the app, the version, the dependencies

79
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,260
and also the NPM scripts.

80
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:43,490
Right.

81
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:50,030
And we also have the node modules folder, which is where all the NPM packages have been installed and

82
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,020
you see that there are hundreds, maybe thousands of them.

83
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,110
But I'm just looking for the React ones here.

84
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,870
And yeah, here they are.

85
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,400
So here is the React package and here the React Dom package.

86
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,600
And remember that these two are exactly the ones that we also included into our file in the pure React

87
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,280
lecture.

88
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,070
Right?

89
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:19,700
But we did it back then using the script tag and of course not using NPM install.

90
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,370
Right.

91
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:29,390
Now if this whole concept here of the NPM project, so this node modules and the package.json is a bit

92
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,770
strange for you, then don't worry, you don't really need to understand all that.

93
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:41,090
But if you want you can just try to read something on it or watch a video or I also explain it all in

94
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,100
my complete JavaScript course.

95
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,730
But again, it's not really necessary.

96
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:52,580
Just know that this is a very, very standard and basically all modern JavaScript projects that have

97
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,530
a build tool associated.

98
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:55,760
Okay.

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,920
But anyway, let's now check out these other folders that have been created for us.

100
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:09,110
Now most of our development work, or basically all development will happen here inside the source folder.

101
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:15,590
So here we have a bunch of files where most of them we actually don't need and so we will get rid of

102
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,370
them soon.

103
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:20,180
But for now, let's just leave everything here as it is.

104
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,500
And checking out the other folder, which is the public folder.

105
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:31,240
And this is where basically all the assets that will end up in the final application go.

106
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:38,930
So all the images like the fav icon and also the index.html file.

107
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:46,520
And if we open that up, we have a bunch of stuff here and well, all of these comments here which you

108
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:53,000
can read if you want, but I just wanted to draw your attention to this div with the ID of root.

109
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,370
So is that familiar to you?

110
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:02,730
Yeah, we wrote exactly the same thing in the Pure React lecture and used this as the root of our app.

111
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:08,220
And so exactly the same convention has been used here by Create React app.

112
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:14,820
So create React app created this index.html file already for us.

113
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:24,030
And then if we open index.js, you see that here, it also selects that route, that root element.

114
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:31,440
So the element with the ID of root and then it creates the root using react dom dot create root and

115
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,050
then renders the app into it.

116
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:37,410
So exactly like we did in the pure React lecture.

117
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:44,070
But more about all this at the beginning of the next section when we actually start building this project.

118
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,150
For now, I just want to explore the file structure here a little bit.

119
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,020
Now what I do want to say in this video is that all of these files and this entire file structure here

120
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:02,770
has been created by Create React App in a way that its developers thought was best, but it could be

121
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:10,210
all completely different, like this index.html could be out here or it could be inside here, or we

122
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:16,030
could maybe have no folders at all because React really doesn't care about any of that.

123
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:22,710
And the proof for that is that in the pure React lecture, we didn't need any of this, right?

124
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,800
All we had was one index.html with some JavaScript in which we basically had this.

125
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:37,660
So this part here is actual react and it's this part which takes care of rendering this app component

126
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,220
into the Dom.

127
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:46,090
So this app component is here inside this app file, but we will open up all of these files and clean

128
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:46,480
them up.

129
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,810
Also once we start actually building the app.

130
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:56,260
For now, I just wanted to explore this a little bit and also I actually wanted to now start this app.

131
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:04,000
So to start a Create React app, we can use this NPM script right here.

132
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,740
So this NPM run start.

133
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,310
So let's open up the terminal again.

134
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:17,840
But as I said in the beginning now we will actually use the integrated terminal that comes with VS code.

135
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:25,250
So for that open up terminal right here and now, the big advantage here is that we are already automatically

136
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,170
inside our project folder.

137
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:35,420
So if we run LHS here or dir on Windows, then you will see exactly the same files and folders that

138
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,400
we have here in the sidebar.

139
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:46,880
But anyway, now to start the project, all we need to do is to run npm run start because this is how

140
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,040
you run these commands right here.

141
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,470
So you write NPM run and then the name of one of these four in this case.

142
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,280
And we could also create our own, but we don't need to.

143
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:03,440
Now, in the case of the Start command, we actually don't even need to write run.

144
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:10,950
We can just type NPM, start, hit, enter and that will then start up our application and even open

145
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,540
up a new browser tab.

146
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,170
And there it is.

147
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:23,060
So Create React app created a web server for us and made our application run here on localhost port

148
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,470
3000.

149
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:33,380
Okay, Now let's just one more time, come back here and open up this app component.

150
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,370
So this app component here is inside the app file.

151
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:45,970
And so let's well, let's just take everything here and just very quickly, type one.

152
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:49,870
Hello, react, give it a save.

153
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:55,970
And then once we go back, it should automatically have updated and indeed it did.

154
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,640
So this was one of the things that we were missing in the pure React lecture.

155
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:07,060
But now here we are actually using a web server and so we get hot module replacement with that.

156
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:08,510
Great.

157
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,280
So congratulations.

158
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,470
You just created your very first Create React app application.

159
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:21,120
And with this we actually reach the end of the first look at React section.

160
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,900
Now, the next section is a quick review of the essential JavaScript that you need for react.

161
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,620
And so you can see if you need any of those lectures.

162
