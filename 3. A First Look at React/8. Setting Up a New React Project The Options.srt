1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:08,640
So as we just learned in the real world, we don't just write React apps in a single JavaScript file

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,620
without any tooling.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:18,060
So let's now learn about the options that we have to set up a brand new React project.

4
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:29,200
And for now, the two most important options are the Create React app tool or a build tool called Vite.

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:38,470
So first, Create React app is basically a complete starter kit for React applications that was developed

6
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,790
many years ago.

7
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:46,350
In order to make it really easy for developers to scaffold new React apps.

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:53,110
And what's really nice about this is that all the common development tools are already pre-configured

9
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,800
out of the box specifically for React.

10
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:05,620
So an app created with Create React app automatically comes with a development server, Webpack for

11
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:13,390
module bundling and of course important developer tools which include a linter like Eslint, a code

12
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:22,460
formatter like prettier, a testing library like jest and of course Babel for enabling the latest JavaScript

13
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,420
features.

14
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:31,670
Now this all sounds great, but the problem with Create React app is that, as I said in the beginning,

15
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:39,920
it was developed many years ago and so it uses some slow and kind of outdated technologies under the

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,730
hood and in particular the Webpack bundler.

17
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:52,580
So the team behind Create React App has really stopped innovating and therefore, right now the recommendation

18
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:58,220
is to not use create, React app for real world projects anymore.

19
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:07,580
It is, however, still a perfectly fine way to get started quickly with a new React app for tutorials

20
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,550
courses or simple experiments.

21
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:17,210
And so therefore we will actually use create React app for most of the course.

22
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:22,070
So for all the small learning projects that we're going to build together.

23
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:30,410
So you might have read all the articles saying that Create React app is dead and that you should never

24
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:31,490
use it again.

25
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:37,310
But that's only true for building real apps again, for learning.

26
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:45,500
It's still 100% fine because you will not encounter the problems that a large scale apps will face like

27
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,300
slow refresh times.

28
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:55,460
Now if you do want to build real world applications with React, as we will do by the end of the course,

29
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,700
then V8 is the perfect choice.

30
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:07,340
Now, Veit is actually quite different from Create React app as it's basically simply a modern build

31
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:15,320
tool, so a bit like a modern Webpack, but which happens to also contain a starter template for setting

32
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,260
up brand new React applications.

33
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:25,970
However, in a React app created with Vite, you will have to manually set up many important developer

34
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:31,970
tools such as Eslint, Prettier, a testing library and so on.

35
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:39,550
And the most annoying and painful of those is setting up Eslint to play nice with React.

36
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,490
So that can be a bit of work and it can go wrong.

37
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:51,410
And so this is the reason why I still recommend using create React app for tutorials when we just want

38
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,530
to get up and running as quickly as possible.

39
00:03:54,830 --> 00:04:02,190
Now, if we have all this additional work to set up our tools, then why even use Vite in the first

40
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:02,850
place?

41
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:11,640
Well, the reason is that it's just extremely fast to automatically refresh the page when the code changes,

42
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,540
which is what we call hot module replacement.

43
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:24,540
Also, bundling is extremely fast too, which for large scale applications can really make a difference

44
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:32,190
because when you have to wait 1 or 2 seconds for each page refresh, it can become really, really annoying

45
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,240
over time.

46
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:40,920
But with Vite, the page will update almost instantly each time that we save our code and want to see

47
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,930
the changes on the screen.

48
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:51,720
So in summary, we will use Create React app for most small apps in this course and then move to Vite

49
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,980
for the last 2 or 3 projects to make them a bit more real world and more modern as well.

50
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:07,610
Now, if you have spent any time looking at the React documentation, you might have read that the React

51
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:17,960
team now advises developers to use a so-called React framework like Next.js or remix to build new projects.

52
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:26,240
So in fact, we have even more options to set up a new React project than the ones that we just talked

53
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,960
about.

54
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:31,390
Now we're going to talk about what React frameworks are.

55
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,820
Throughout the course.

56
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:40,590
But for now, all you need to know is that a framework like Next.js contains solutions for things like

57
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:44,460
routing, data fetching and server side rendering.

58
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:50,190
So things that react itself does not provide easily out of the box.

59
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:59,310
So essentially a React framework is a framework built on top of the React library and which is going

60
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:05,980
to make it even easier to build applications then with just vanilla react itself.

61
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,940
And this sounds great, right?

62
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,180
Well, yeah, it kind of does, but only for some applications.

63
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:23,880
However many people and that include me, think that telling developers to always immediately go for

64
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,680
a React framework is not the best idea and not always necessary.

65
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:37,870
Vanilla react apps so apps built only using react still have a very important place too.

66
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:43,120
And so forcing this opinion on everyone seems kind of strange.

67
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:46,810
But again, we will discuss this later on.

68
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:55,060
Now, in any case, this advice only makes sense for building actual production ready products, but

69
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:01,630
not for learning React, which is of course what we are trying to do in this course.

70
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:09,880
So even if at some point you want to learn next.js as well, of course you still need to learn react

71
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,620
itself first.

72
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:18,850
So all this is to say that you should not worry about this recommendation for now.

73
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:27,130
For now, let's just learn, react and set up new projects with Create React app first and then with

74
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,560
Vite in the bigger projects.

75
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:38,470
And with all this being said, let's now actually go create or very first real React application.
