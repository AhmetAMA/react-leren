1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,170
Now before we start coding and learn all about React, let's quickly set up our development environment

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,550
in this lecture.

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:15,610
Now, since you're taking this course, I'm assuming that you already did some coding before and therefore

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:19,810
you will already have some code editor installed on your computer.

5
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,400
And if that code editor is vs code, then congratulations.

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,970
You're already using the best code editor out there.

7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:35,380
But if you're using some other code editor, then I would highly recommend you to download vs code simply

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:41,620
by downloading the installer from here and then installing it just like any other application.

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:47,830
And by doing so you can then customize the editor just like I do in this course, which will make it

10
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,410
a little bit easier for you to follow everything.

11
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:56,800
Next up, of course, we need a web browser to actually run the applications that we are going to build,

12
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,020
and I'm using Google Chrome for that.

13
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:05,170
And so I highly encourage you to use the same browser so that our results are going to look the same.

14
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,980
So if you don't have it installed yet, then make sure to do that right now.

15
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:15,380
And finally, we are going to need to install NodeJS on our system.

16
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,620
And this is not because we will do some NodeJS development, but it's simply because all the tools that

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,260
we're going to use run on NodeJS.

18
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,430
And it's important that you use at least Node version 18.

19
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:34,580
And so if you're not sure about which version you are currently running or if maybe you never installed

20
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:39,860
NodeJS before, then please go ahead and download it here from this first button.

21
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:48,470
And it doesn't matter if it's Node 18 or 20 or 22 or whatever because of course this node version will

22
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:49,970
change in the future.

23
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:54,080
But what matters is that it is at least version 18.

24
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,100
Okay.

25
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,870
And with these three tools in place, let's now configure vs code a little bit.

26
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,400
So open up a new VS code window which will then look something like this.

27
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,510
So it might have changed a bit in the future, but basically it will look something like this.

28
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,620
And so here from the left sidebar, let's now install two essential extensions.

29
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,480
The first one is Eslint, which is a code Linter.

30
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:26,600
So basically a program that will automatically find errors in our code or find some best practices that

31
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,620
were violating.

32
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:33,080
And maybe you have already used this linter before, but if not really, make sure to download it.

33
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:37,250
It's really popular with over 25 million installs.

34
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:45,170
Then another extension that we really need is prettier because prettier will automatically format our

35
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:49,370
code, for example, to remove empty lines and stuff like that.

36
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:55,010
And this is really important for you to follow this course because it will make your code look exactly

37
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,140
the same as my code in the videos.

38
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,280
And so that will help you find any bugs that you might have created.

39
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,710
So please go ahead and download this extension here.

40
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:10,530
And if we need any more extensions throughout the course, we will then just install them as we go.

41
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:16,670
Now about the color theme that I'm using here, it is called one Mono Chi.

42
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,880
So that's this one down here.

43
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:26,590
So again, if you want your editor to look just like mine, then just go ahead, download it here and

44
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:28,420
then set the color theme.

45
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,840
You can also do that down here.

46
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,410
All right.

47
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:40,550
Now, besides this overall color theme, I also use a theme for the file icons in the file tree.

48
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,660
And so that one is called material icons.

49
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:51,500
And so make sure to download this one as well and then set this file icon theme, which again, you

50
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,990
can also do it down here.

51
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,000
All right.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,800
So with this, we tweaked the appearance of our VS code a little bit.

53
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,230
And of course you can go ahead and install as many extensions as you'd like, but I will now move on

54
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:08,570
to set some settings.

55
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,420
So that's very important as well.

56
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,450
And the first one is the autosave setting.

57
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,690
So you can just search that here and probably this is already the default, but I'm not really sure.

58
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:27,470
So just make sure to set autosave to on focus change, which will ensure that your code gets saved each

59
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:31,220
time that you go to a different tab or to a different window.

60
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:32,920
Next time.

61
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,470
We need to now set the prettier extension that we installed as our default.

62
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:43,130
A four metre.

63
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,900
So that's this setting right here.

64
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:53,070
So make sure to set it here to prettier code formatter.

65
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:59,130
So otherwise sometimes vs code doesn't know how to activate prettier.

66
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,860
And then also we want to tell vs code to do this formatting on save.

67
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:12,450
So let's search for the setting format on save and then let's simply turn this on right here.

68
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:21,830
Then about Eslint, we can set the Eslint run setting here and set it to on save.

69
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:28,640
So basically by default, Eslint will run each time that you type a new character, which might be a

70
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,550
bit too much.

71
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:35,300
And so by setting this here, Eslint will only check our code each time that we save it, which usually

72
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,580
is more than enough.

73
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,390
But of course if you want, you can also leave the default which is on type.

74
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,480
Okay, so that's all the settings that we need.

75
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:52,030
Next up, let's quickly make sure that you actually have NodeJS installed now.

76
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:58,000
And so for that, let's open up a new terminal, which I like to do using this shortcut that you should

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,950
see up here on the screen.

78
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:08,650
And so then to check your node version, just type node dash V and so make sure again that your node

79
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,020
version is at least version 18.

80
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,200
And if not, just go ahead and install it once again.

81
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,490
All right.

82
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:18,880
And now to finish, let's just set up some snippets.

83
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:26,650
So snippets are basically some pieces of predefined code that we can use to greatly speed up development.

84
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:34,180
So I actually prepared a file of three snippets that we're going to use a lot, and they are here in

85
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,620
the starter files that we downloaded from GitHub right in the first section.

86
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,160
So make sure to open it up.

87
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,240
And this file is right here in the very first folder called Setup.

88
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:53,290
So let's open this file here, for example, by dragging and dropping it here onto this vs code icon.

89
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,810
But if for some reason that doesn't work for you, you can of course always just open it here the normal

90
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,320
way.

91
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,360
Right, Then just select everything and copy it.

92
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:10,960
So copy this entire code and then come down here to user snippets.

93
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:12,470
No.

94
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,050
Right.

95
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,220
And then it might be that you already have some snippets file.

96
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,250
And so in that case you can just open one of them.

97
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:26,010
But if not, just go ahead and create a new snippets file by clicking here on this option.

98
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:33,630
So I will just use this one that I already have, and let's just pretend that it's empty so I will just

99
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:39,330
empty it out and then I will copy paste that code from here to here.

100
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,670
So what we have here are three snippets.

101
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,160
This one is to easily create a console dot log.

102
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,980
This one is to create a react functional component.

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So that's what this RFC stands for.

104
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,030
And this one is for React styled component and we will see what these do later.

105
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:05,580
So, for example, this first one here to just print to the console will be activated each time that

106
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:15,600
we type in a JavaScript, a TypeScript or a React file, and it will then replace that with this console

107
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,840
dot log and it will also then place the cursor between these parentheses, which is going to be really

108
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,530
useful.

109
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,070
So this is really powerful stuff.

110
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:30,150
And again, we will come back to these other two and use them later.

111
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,350
Okay.

112
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:34,120
And with this, we're actually done.

113
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:41,050
So we're all set up to now move on to finally start learning, react, and to start writing our own

114
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:41,660
code.

115
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,590
So hopefully I see you soon in the next lecture.
