00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:07,980
Welcome to the last and optional section of the intermediate React part of the course.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,020
This one is all about class based react.

3
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:19,310
So once upon a time we used to write React components in quite a different way.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:26,360
Instead of using functions and hooks, we used classes and so called lifecycle methods.

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:34,130
Now you will most likely never have to write a class component in your work or personal projects, but

6
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:41,720
you will encounter them in older code bases and you might even need to convert class components to function

7
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,730
components at some point.

8
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:51,260
That's why I've decided to include a section on this legacy way of writing React code.

9
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:58,400
Now, if you're concerned that this different syntax will confuse you, please just skip this section

10
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,320
for now and come back to it later.

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,570
Or only if you ever need to learn about these class components at your job.

12
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:14,760
But if you're curious about this historical part of React, then let's move right on.
