1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,360
Okay, so let's start working on the classy weather application.

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:12,040
And let's start by duplicating this file here.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,320
And then let's call.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,500
This one here, the counter, so that we can keep the code that we wrote previously.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,300
And so now let's delete everything from here and start from scratch.

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,980
So we start by importing react.

7
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,520
From React.

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,200
And then again we use a JavaScript class.

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,040
We call it app and it need to extend react.

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,660
Dot component so that we can inherit all the things that we need from React.

11
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:56,750
Here inside this class, for example, the render method to return some JS.

12
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:03,820
So let's actually start writing that JS for our classy weather application.

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,420
So starting with a div of the app class name.

14
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,630
And as always, you can check out the CSS file that is part of this section.

15
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,550
And let's start with an H one with the name of the app.

16
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,680
So classy weather.

17
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:27,700
Then let's create a div with an input field.

18
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:35,690
And so this field will basically be for the location for which we want to search the weather.

19
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:39,080
So this will be of the type of text.

20
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,880
And let's also add a placeholder.

21
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,930
Search for.

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,190
Location.

23
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,030
No.

24
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,660
Okay.

25
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:54,550
And now all we need to do is to export that component.

26
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,610
And there we go.

27
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:04,670
We just need to make this a lot smaller so that it actually fits our screen.

28
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,780
And so now here we can search for any city.

29
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,420
So just like here in this demo application.

30
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:16,720
Now here in this app, we for now also want a button.

31
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,210
Sew a button to search for the weather.

32
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,300
So get weather like this.

33
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,620
Okay.

34
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,230
And next up, let's make this input field here a controlled element.

35
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,250
So an element where React controls and owns the state.

36
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:42,420
And so this idea of controlled elements is exactly the same as before in function components.

37
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,960
So many of the things that we learned previously still apply to class components.

38
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:56,010
And so this means that we now need to give this component state and remember that we do that by calling

39
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:02,040
the constructor method, which is a method that is available on all JavaScript classes.

40
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:10,320
So this is not coming from React, but this one is called with props so that we can then call the parent

41
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,160
component.

42
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:16,410
So that is react component by using here the super keyword.

43
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,710
And again, we do that with perhaps.

44
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,350
Okay, so this is really like a recipe that you need to follow and it's always the same.

45
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:31,840
And so that's why we say that these class components have a lot more boilerplate code.

46
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,810
So it's all of this stuff that doesn't really do much, but which we still have to do in order to make

47
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,590
this work.

48
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:48,670
But anyway, let's now define state again by using this dot state and then setting it to an object.

49
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,850
And this one will have the location property.

50
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,310
And let's start with a default location.

51
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,490
So, for example, Lisbon.

52
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:07,930
And so now, just like always, we use this state as a value, but now that state lives in this dot

53
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,650
state.

54
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,960
Dot location.

55
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:18,040
So as we save this, we see that immediately our state got added to our input field.

56
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,570
Nice.

57
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:28,050
Now all we have to do is to then listen for the change event and update the state as the user types.

58
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:34,150
And so again, we get the current event and then here we set the state.

59
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:43,330
So in class components, we do this by using this dot set state and then we pass in the new object.

60
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,070
Or at least the properties that have changed.

61
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:55,190
So location will be equal to e dot target dot value.

62
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,080
And so if we reload this now.

63
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,470
And that's working just fine.

64
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,770
And we can see that also here in the dev tools.

65
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:09,840
So you see that just like before, we can see the entire state down here.

66
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:16,530
The only difference is that now it doesn't say hooks and it doesn't have here the numbers for the hooks,

67
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,880
of course, as well.

68
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:22,140
But besides that, yeah, everything works the same.

69
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:29,750
Now notice that here in this event handler function, we didn't have to manually bind the disk keyword

70
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,130
like we did before.

71
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,970
We only have to do that when we define the event handler as an outside method, which is exactly what

72
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,590
we will do next.

73
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,570
So basically, as an event handler for the event of clicking here on this button.

74
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,810
So let's do that.

75
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,940
And let's call it fetch.

76
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,030
Whether.

77
00:05:52,940 --> 00:06:00,080
And for now, we will only just log something here to the console like loading data.

78
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:05,040
And then let's also again log the disk keyword here.

79
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,150
So just so we see again the problem that we have.

80
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,070
So let's attach that here.

81
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:21,950
And so again, that is this dot and then whatever name of the method.

82
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,860
So let's see.

83
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,240
And well, here we have the wrong prop name.

84
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,660
Let's just reload that.

85
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:40,370
And now as we click here, we get loading data and we also get again that our this keyword is undefined.

86
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:47,060
And that's going to be a problem because we will need the this keyword here to later set some state.

87
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:55,490
And so just like we did in our counter, we need to now explicitly bind the this keyword to this method.

88
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:06,340
So we say this dot weather is equal to this dot fetch weather and then we explicitly bind the this keyword

89
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,650
to this method.

90
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:14,530
So basically giving it access to the current component instance so that then we can set the state on

91
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,100
there.

92
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,810
So give it a save.

93
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,040
Try that again.

94
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:22,680
And now indeed we get our current component instance here.

95
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:25,120
So it has our state and everything.

96
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,470
And if we change that here, then of course it won't change here.

97
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,000
But if we do that again.

98
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,400
Then.

99
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:32,880
Yeah.

100
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,300
Now we have the new updated state right there.

101
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,500
Okay.

102
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:42,930
And with this, we are now ready to actually fetch the weather data in the next video.
