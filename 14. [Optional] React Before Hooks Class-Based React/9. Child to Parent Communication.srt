00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:07,740
Let me now show you a quick example of child to parent communication, which is a very important thing

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,210
in React development.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,100
And it works basically exactly the same in class based react.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:22,380
So what I want to do now is to quickly extract this input right here into its own component.

5
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:25,710
So let's actually grab all of this here.

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,790
And then let's create a new class here.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,070
So a new component just called input.

8
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,620
Which extends react dot component.

9
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,370
And then the render method.

10
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:54,570
From which we simply return what we just cut there and then let's come back here and simply include

11
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:55,770
that.

12
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,370
Input.

13
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,280
All right.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:07,620
But of course, then we get some errors because this input here depends on some state and on updating

15
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:12,540
state, which is not living anymore in this current component.

16
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:20,340
So the location state, of course, needs to stay in the app component because we need it here in this

17
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,570
other method.

18
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,330
So here in this fetch weather event handler.

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,130
So we need to do what we always do, which is to pass in.

20
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,290
These things as props.

21
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:42,820
So this data of location and so that's at this dot state dot location.

22
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,900
And then here we receive that as props.

23
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:54,590
So now it's no longer this dot state dot location, but this dot props, dot, location.

24
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,910
And so if I give it a safe now, then we are back to working here.

25
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:07,380
However, the state will of course still not update because the state again still lives in that other

26
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,120
component.

27
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,660
So in the app component.

28
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,550
And so this is where child to parent communication comes into play again.

29
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:22,260
So remember that that basically means that a child component needs to update the state in a parent component.

30
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:29,220
And the way we do that is to simply pass down the state updating function into the child component.

31
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:35,680
So basically we need now this and pass it as a prop.

32
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:43,380
So let's grab that and actually let's create a brand new event handler function here.

33
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:47,140
And we will do it just like this other one.

34
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,340
So just like we did in the previous lecture as a class field.

35
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,270
So let's call this one set.

36
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,840
Location, and then this one needs to receive the event.

37
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,760
And actually it's just copy paste at this point.

38
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,580
So let's remove that.

39
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:11,790
And so with this, we created ourselves the event handler.

40
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,260
And so now all we have to do is to pass that in also here.

41
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,920
So let's call that prop maybe on.

42
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:21,650
Change.

43
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,310
Location.

44
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,720
And then the set location function.

45
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,290
So actually this dot set location.

46
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:38,970
So we have so many disks here, it's getting a bit confusing indeed.

47
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,540
So on change location, let's just copy that.

48
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,500
And so.

49
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:50,060
Now again this dot props dot on change location.

50
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:55,970
And so now we are back to being able to change the input here.

51
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:00,500
But now we are doing it using child to parent communication.

52
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:08,900
So this technique is just as important in class based react as in function, component based, react.

53
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:16,400
So the whole thinking in react part is actually exactly the same in class and in function components.
