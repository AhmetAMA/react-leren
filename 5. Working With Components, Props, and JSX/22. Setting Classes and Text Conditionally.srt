1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:02,620
To finish this project.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:10,240
Let's learn how to conditionally set some text inside elements and also how to conditionally set class

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,990
names.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:19,860
So if we take one final look at our final project, the only difference is that this pizza here that

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,480
is sold out has this text of sold out instead of the price.

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,560
And the whole element here is kind of grayed out.

7
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,250
So just to show that it's not available.

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,740
And so let's now do that.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,650
So right now we have this line of code here, which makes it so that the sold out pizza is not even

10
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:42,370
displayed.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,420
So let's start by getting rid of that.

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:52,420
And so now we are ready to conditionally display some text and we are going to do it right here.

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:59,920
So the difference between what we did before is that before we did conditionally render this entire

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,920
element here, but now that's not what we want.

15
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:08,950
Now, we already know that we want this span element here, but we don't want the content yet.

16
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,450
And so let's now conditionally set that and that's very easy.

17
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,290
So once again, we are going to use our ternary operator.

18
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:23,080
So let's say pizza object.

19
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,690
Not sold out.

20
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,290
Then the text here should be.

21
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,910
And now what do you think we need here?

22
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:35,270
Well, it's just a string, actually.

23
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,650
So sold out.

24
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:41,400
And if not, then we want the pizzas price.

25
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,250
Give it a save.

26
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,630
And.

27
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,530
Yeah.

28
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,690
Nice.

29
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,930
That worked.

30
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,880
Let's just make it uppercase.

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,890
It should be handled by the CSS, but we can also just do it like this.

32
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,520
All right.

33
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,820
So let's again appreciate the difference here.

34
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,860
So we're not setting the element conditionally, which of course, we could.

35
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,280
So let's just quickly do that, because why not?

36
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,930
So we could say.

37
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,780
If pizza object dot sold out.

38
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,790
Then display despaigne with sold out.

39
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,400
And if not.

40
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,050
Then display despaigne with.

41
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:29,430
Pizza.

42
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,480
Dot price.

43
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,310
So the result is going to be exactly the same as we see down here.

44
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,200
But what we did is fundamentally different.

45
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,520
So here we already know that we want a span element.

46
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,100
We just don't know yet the content.

47
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:56,050
While here, we apparently also don't know yet what element we want though in both cases we are then

48
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,070
using a span.

49
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,010
And so I think it's a lot better to do it like this.

50
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,760
So to conditionally set the text content of an element.

51
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,700
This is way cleaner in my opinion.

52
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,810
But just for reference, I will leave this one here as well.

53
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,490
Okay.

54
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:20,530
And now, finally, as for the class name, whenever the pizza is sold out, we can add the sold out

55
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:25,270
class to the list, which will then make it grayed out.

56
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,620
Let me show that to you.

57
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,740
You can simply add it to all of them.

58
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,800
And so then you see this is the result we are going for.

59
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:40,140
But of course we only want this part here whenever the pizza is actually sold out.

60
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,360
So let's again use our ternary operator for that.

61
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,610
So this is how we're going to do it.

62
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,580
We will now use, instead of a regular string, a template literal.

63
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,120
So deleting the quote and deleting this.

64
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:01,010
But now this is actually JavaScript, so a template literal is JavaScript.

65
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,070
Therefore let's enter JavaScript mode.

66
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,740
Give it a save.

67
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,720
And so for now, it is exactly what we had before.

68
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,830
But now inside this template literal, we can.

69
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:18,950
Well, kind of enter the template literal JavaScript mode as well in this way.

70
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,170
So remember that it's actually quite similar.

71
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,760
The idea then entering JavaScript mode inside of JSX.

72
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,070
Right.

73
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,820
The difference here that in the template literal to add some piece of code, we also need this one,

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,660
right?

75
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,160
So this dollar sign.

76
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:44,070
But then here we can once again make use of our friend, the ternary operator.

77
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,470
So we can say pizza object.

78
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,750
Sold out.

79
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,670
If yes, then.

80
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,710
Here, give us the string.

81
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,640
Of sold out.

82
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,610
But if not, then just an empty string.

83
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,530
And this should be enough.

84
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,940
And yeah, beautiful.

85
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,150
So this is exactly what we were going for.

86
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,390
So let's recap why this worked.

87
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:18,420
So we have our template literal, and then here we simply write a JavaScript expression.

88
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,300
So then with the ternary operator, we check if this exists, and if so.

89
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,550
So if this is true, then the result of this operator will be sold out.

90
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:36,060
And so then this entire thing here becomes sold out and then the string is exactly what we had before.

91
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,870
So pizza space sold out.

92
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,140
But if this is false, then we will simply return nothing here.

93
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:49,530
So then the string is just pizza, which is well, what we have here in all of these cases.

94
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,990
So you see here, the class is just pizza.

95
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,860
With the space, of course, that we have here, but that's no problem at all.

96
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,220
And then here we have pizza sold out.

97
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,300
Great.

98
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:07,790
So this is how we conditionally set some CSS classes onto elements.

99
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:14,240
So all without using the class list property that we would have to use in vanilla JavaScript.

100
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:21,380
And for this down here, remember in vanilla JavaScript we would have to do some Dom manipulation with

101
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,050
the text content property or inner HTML or something like that.

102
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:33,140
But here with the declarative nature of JSX and react, everything becomes just a little bit easier

103
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,710
and nicer to work with.

104
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,300
And now just one final detail.

105
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:45,920
Let's come here to our public folder and in the index.html we will want to set now the title of the

106
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,760
document.

107
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:55,400
So here we have Fast React Pizza Co, but here it just says the default React app, which is a bit ugly.

108
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,640
So let's say fast react Pizza Co.

109
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,680
And that's it.

110
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,290
So at this we actually finished our application and our very first project.

111
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:16,980
So congratulations for making it all the way here until the end of this long section.

112
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:23,040
And now just to finish this section, we will have a lecture to review everything that we just learned

113
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,140
because it was a lot.

114
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:31,470
And then finally, there is another coding challenge waiting for you just so you can practice again

115
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:34,530
what you learned here over the last few lectures.

116
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:40,860
But before going there, I would invite you to once again check out the entire code that we wrote here

117
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:47,850
together, see how all the components are related, and really check out again everything that you learned

118
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,960
even before checking out that summary lecture that's going to follow.

119
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,570
And then after that, of course, what that lecture to really drive the message home.
