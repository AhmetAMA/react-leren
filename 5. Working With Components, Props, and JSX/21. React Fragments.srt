1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:07,030
Let's now learn what a React fragment is and when exactly we might need one.

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:15,200
So let's actually come here to the final version of the application so that I can show you that we are

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,150
actually still missing something.

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,640
And that's this sentence right here.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:27,740
So there is a paragraph of text right here that I'm just going to copy now and you can maybe pause the

6
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,490
video and type it, or you can just type something shorter.

7
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,850
So let's for now place that paragraph here.

8
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:37,940
Give it a save.

9
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,290
And.

10
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:40,520
Yeah.

11
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:42,530
Then it looks exactly the same.

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:46,400
But now what if we have no pizzas at all?

13
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,740
So in this case, well, then we actually don't want to show this.

14
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:56,670
So this sentence right here, we only want this one.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,360
So the one that's coming here from our conditional rendering.

16
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,390
So let's put that back.

17
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,060
And what that means is that we only want to render this paragraph here in this situation.

18
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,100
So let's grab that paragraph and place that here.

19
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:23,230
Because again, we want to render this paragraph and this ul.

20
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,310
In this case.

21
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:27,970
But immediately react starts yelling at us.

22
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,050
So JSX expressions must have one parent element.

23
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:37,900
And so this is exactly what we learned in the rules of JSX lecture.

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:45,760
So a piece of JSX, no matter where it is defined, can only have in fact, one root element.

25
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:52,120
And this has happened to us before and the way we always solved this was by simply wrapping everything

26
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:56,110
in a div or some other component.

27
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:57,760
So let's try that.

28
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:04,270
You don't have to do this and this is just to show you that this will then actually mess up our formatting

29
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:04,840
here.

30
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,600
So this is actually not really what we want.

31
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:15,190
We do not want to render one element which contains these two, but we really want to render these two

32
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,030
elements here.

33
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:22,910
So these two elements in separate without it having one element as a parent of these two.

34
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,020
Right.

35
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:28,940
And so this is the case in which we need a react fragment.

36
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:37,070
So a react fragment basically lets us group some elements without leaving any trace in the HTML tree.

37
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:44,300
So in the Dom, so it looks like here we need a react fragment and that's very easy.

38
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,410
All we have to do is to basically delete everything here.

39
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,980
Just like this.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,100
And so this is now a fragment.

41
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,740
So let's save.

42
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,480
And then we are back to what we had before.

43
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,320
So now let's then inspect the Dom tree.

44
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:07,120
As I was saying, just to show you that actually this didn't create any new element at all.

45
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,930
So here we have the header and see, we still have that footer class there.

46
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:14,480
Of course.

47
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,830
Let's get rid of that.

48
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,470
All right.

49
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,680
So we have our container, then we have the menu, then we have the H2.

50
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:25,760
So this one.

51
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,660
And then.

52
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,250
Exactly, we have the paragraph and the Ul, but in a separate.

53
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:33,580
So not wrapped in anything.

54
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:39,680
So this is completely invisible here and it's exactly what we were looking for and that's it.

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,730
That's all a react fragment is and it's all that it does.

56
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:48,420
Now, sometimes we need to add a key to a react fragment.

57
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:54,850
So, for example, when we are using it to render a list and so then we need to actually write it in

58
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,170
a slightly different way.

59
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,240
So first, let's make sure that we have react imported and we do.

60
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,710
So it's right here.

61
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,300
And so we can write, react.

62
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,050
Dot fragment.

63
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:15,730
And then down here, we need to close that react dot fragment.

64
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,700
And so then the result is exactly the same.

65
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:22,450
But if we need it, then here we could add a key.

66
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,000
Of just anything.

67
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:31,480
All right, Now, we don't need a key, so we can just go for the short version, which is, of course,

68
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,680
a lot nicer.

69
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,090
All right, let's try maybe something else.

70
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,530
Let's say that here we actually didn't want this container.

71
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,900
So maybe we just needed all our elements right here directly in the root.

72
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:53,730
So basically, what we wanted in this case is the app component to return three components.

73
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,730
So these three elements made out of these three components.

74
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,100
And so then that would be very simple.

75
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,980
Now, in our case, it's of course going to mess up the formatting because then we are missing the container

76
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,670
class.

77
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,620
But just as an example, this is what it would look like in the end.

78
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,070
So we would have our route with immediately these three as direct children.

79
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,400
But let's put everything back.

80
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,420
And yeah, I think that's all that you need to know about React Fragments.

81
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:32,290
It's a very simple concept which basically allows us to have more than just one element inside a piece

82
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:32,770
of JSX.
