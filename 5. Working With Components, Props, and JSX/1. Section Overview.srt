00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:09,330
In this section, we're going to explore three core concepts of building React apps, components, props

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:18,510
and JS X, so we'll learn how components are the building blocks of React applications and how to create

3
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,920
and reuse them using the powerful JS syntax.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:30,540
We're also going to share data between components using props and learn about rendering lists, conditional

5
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:36,570
rendering and more, all while building this first beautiful project.

6
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:44,550
Along the way, you will start practicing react on your own by building a developer profile card using

7
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,560
these fundamental skills.

8
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:46,980
Now.

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,170
Okay, so let's go start this React journey right now.
