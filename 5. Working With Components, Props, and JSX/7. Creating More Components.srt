1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:08,330
So with our new knowledge about JSX, let's now create a couple more components to keep building our

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:09,260
application.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,770
But before we do that, this is probably the perfect time to show you the application as it will look

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,680
like after we are finished with this section.

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,630
So basically we have this header here with the name of a pizzeria.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:32,190
Then down here we have the menu and then basically here we have some kind of footer letting the user

7
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,680
know that the restaurant is currently open.

8
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:39,090
And this button, which of course doesn't do anything once we click it.

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,610
So here is like the heart of this application, which is the display of these six pizzas.

10
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,940
And notice how we already kind of displayed this pizza here.

11
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:58,740
And so here you see that we are going to reuse this pizza component six time in order to print these

12
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,910
six pizzas.

13
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,310
All right.

14
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:08,430
But now what I want to do in this lecture is to basically focus more on these bigger layout components.

15
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,710
So let's create one component for each of these three big parts.

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,970
So one for the header.

17
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,880
So a component called header and we can leave this empty for now.

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,730
We are just building out here the structure.

19
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,190
Then one for the menu.

20
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,430
And then one for the footer.

21
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,090
And here I'm always missing the parentheses.

22
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,220
So that's not good.

23
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,480
Yeah.

24
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,360
Nice.

25
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:53,380
And just by the way, we could of course, also write these functions as function expressions and arrow

26
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,070
functions.

27
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:59,470
So we could also do const, let's just call it test equal.

28
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:05,200
Function like this or even simpler, it could be an arrow function.

29
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:10,060
So if you prefer these types of functions, feel free to use those.

30
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:15,760
But I always like to use the regular function keyword as I have been using.

31
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,780
But anyway, let's now.

32
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,080
Return something from here.

33
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:28,750
And so here is where we write that name of the restaurant, which is fast React Pizza.

34
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,630
Company.

35
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:32,910
All right.

36
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,560
And here we can now use this component instead of this one.

37
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,920
And again, we include it here.

38
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,960
As if it was just any other element.

39
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,780
And so that's the beauty of.

40
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:57,610
So it changed to fast react pizza code right here now and let's next up, create a footer.

41
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:04,100
And here, let's actually play around a little bit with DJs and with Create Element.

42
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:10,620
So using the knowledge that we gained in the previous lecture, let's instead of immediately returning

43
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,520
the DJs return a create element call.

44
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:26,040
So react dot create element just so you can see how bad it would be to write components this way without

45
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,340
JSX.

46
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:31,380
So we want to return an HTML note.

47
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,880
So an HTML element named footer.

48
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,080
Then here the second argument is null because it is for props.

49
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,780
And then here is the child element.

50
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:44,350
So here we just want some text, let's say.

51
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,340
Interiors must actually be a string now.

52
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:50,650
Were.

53
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,420
Currently.

54
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,000
Open.

55
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,290
And now, of course, we need to then use the component here in the app.

56
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,580
So that's footer.

57
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,940
Close it immediately and.

58
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,450
And let's check it out down here.

59
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,610
Yeah, there is our footer.

60
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,470
We can see that also here.

61
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,630
At least if we had some space.

62
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:20,600
Yeah.

63
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,660
So in a body we have of course or route where the entire application is rendered.

64
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:30,320
Then we have this div right here, which is this one.

65
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,820
So coming from the app component.

66
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:42,280
And then we have here the H1, which is this one here, and then these three divs each for one pizza

67
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,190
and finally the footer that we just created.

68
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:52,720
So of course here in the actual HTML, we will no longer see the name of our components, right?

69
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,200
Because once react renders everything into the Dom, it only renders the H1 element itself.

70
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:07,210
So the Dom doesn't know that this H1 is actually coming from this header component and that these Divs

71
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,660
for example, are actually coming from a pizza component.

72
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,820
This web page that is now being rendered here has no idea about any of that.

73
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:17,570
Okay.

74
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:22,760
But anyway, going back here to our footer, let's now just comment this out.

75
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,290
And then return what we actually want to return.

76
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,980
Which is for now actually the same, but written in a nice way.

77
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:39,460
So we're currently open and now let's actually enter JavaScript mode here.

78
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:47,380
Why not just to do some JavaScript in here and let's just display the current time.

79
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,000
We actually did that before.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,360
So just create a new date and then dot to local time string.

81
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,800
All right.

82
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,660
And so down here.

83
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,670
We see that right now?

84
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,010
It's this time we're currently open.

85
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,210
Nice.

86
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,920
So this is the power of being able to combine JavaScript basically right into the HTML.

87
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,750
So just as we learned in the previous lecture.

88
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:20,320
Now, finally, we have the menu here.

89
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,450
And what do we want in the menu?

90
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,990
Well, let's start by adding an H2 here.

91
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:34,510
Just saying our menu and then let's actually place our pizzas here.

92
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,650
So these pizzas should actually be part of the menu.

93
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,640
So let's do that.

94
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,130
You can just write pizza.

95
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:51,580
But then, of course, React is not going to be happy about that because remember, each time that we

96
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:55,930
write one piece of JS that can only have.

97
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,710
Basically one root element.

98
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,570
All right, so let's remove all the pizzas.

99
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,690
So I'm cutting them.

100
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,100
And place them here.

101
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:14,870
And now they are gone from here because we didn't include the menu yet.

102
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:18,850
So let's quickly do that.

103
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,020
And there we go.

104
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:27,320
So we have the same result as before, but now our components are even more nested.

105
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,560
So all of this here is the app component.

106
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,300
And then inside the app we have the menu component nested into it.

107
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,120
And then inside the menu we have these four pizza components.

108
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:46,940
And so now you really start to see this idea that we build complex user interfaces by combining small

109
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,010
components into bigger ones.

110
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,740
So we have these really small pizza components.

111
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:58,190
Then we combine a couple of them into one slightly bigger component, which is the menu, which we then

112
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:04,220
combine with header and footer to create the overall big app component.
