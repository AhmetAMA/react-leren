1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:07,040
Let's now take a quick first look at writing logic inside of React components.

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:15,710
Now we have already written some JavaScript logic before, but we always did it just inside the JS that

3
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,700
is returned.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,520
So just like here, right?

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,630
But since components are just JavaScript functions, we can of course do any JavaScript in them that

6
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:32,260
we want and that code is then simply executed as soon as the function is called.

7
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,630
So as soon as the component is initialized.

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,790
So for example, here we can create any new variable that we want.

9
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,980
Let's say our.

10
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,230
And here I will again create a new date.

11
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:55,150
And then let's say get ours and then we can lock that to the console.

12
00:00:55,150 --> 00:01:00,130
And now we're going to use that snippet for the first time that we set up earlier.

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:06,280
So here we can just write cl hit enter and then our.

14
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,490
So let's check out our console.

15
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,820
And so here, yeah, we have the number nine.

16
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,890
So that's currently the our.

17
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:22,640
And now what I want to do here is to basically display an alert in the app whether the restaurant is

18
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,350
currently open or not.

19
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,040
So let's define a few more variables for that.

20
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:33,580
So open our.

21
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:43,040
So let's say that the pizzeria actually opens at 12 p.m. and closes at 10 p.m. So that's a 12 and 22

22
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,660
for the close hour.

23
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,430
So close.

24
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,700
Hour equals 22.

25
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,130
And so now again, we can use any JavaScript in here.

26
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,460
So let's just write a simple if else statement saying.

27
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,340
That if the hour is greater or equal, the open hour and.

28
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,150
The hour is less or equal.

29
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,130
To close our.

30
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:14,860
Then just alert.

31
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,650
We're currently.

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,120
Open.

33
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,820
So alert is just a built in JavaScript function.

34
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,470
So that you should be familiar with.

35
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:35,010
Maybe we'll just use this here as a demonstration that we can write some simple JavaScript in here.

36
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,520
So alert.

37
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,990
Sorry.

38
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,090
Were closed.

39
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,400
And here we need some double quotes like this.

40
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,890
And here we have some bug.

41
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:54,550
So probably JavaScript wants us to include the semicolon here.

42
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,470
And there it is.

43
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,810
So sorry, we are closed.

44
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,350
And that's because right now it is nine in the morning.

45
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,700
And you saw that it happened here twice.

46
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,430
And that's because of the strict mode that I was telling you before.

47
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,200
So in strict mode, our components are usually rendered twice.

48
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,500
And so that's why we got that alert twice as well.

49
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,130
Now, if we change the open hour here, let's say to eight and rerender.

50
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,740
Then it says we are currently open.

51
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:33,200
Now, right now, this alert function is actually blocking JavaScript and so that's why it runs in the

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,360
beginning, but nothing else happens.

53
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:41,520
And so, of course, this is really not ideal and we wouldn't use this in a real app, but this was

54
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,890
just a short demo here anyway.

55
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:52,680
So let's just comment all of this out and just to use this code here because it will actually become

56
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,670
useful later.

57
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:58,140
Let's create a variable here called is open.

58
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:04,830
And so that will then simply become a true or false value, depending on whether this condition is true

59
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:05,610
or false.

60
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,140
Let's lock that then to the console.

61
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,110
Like this.

62
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:13,450
Well, what's happening here?

63
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,670
Yeah, that's better.

64
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:18,860
And you see that right now it's open.

65
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:22,280
Let's set that back to 12.

66
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,870
And there we go.
