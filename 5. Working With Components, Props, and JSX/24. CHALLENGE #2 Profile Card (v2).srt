1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:08,900
So let's now finish the developer profile card in this second coding challenge of this section.

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:17,120
So we are still building this developer profile card here, but now we will do it in a slightly different

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,160
and a little bit better way.

4
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,400
So let's come over here just so I can show you what I want to do now.

5
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,600
And so.

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:29,990
First off, we now have an array of skills.

7
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:34,280
And so in this array we have one object for each skill.

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,830
So basically, we will now create one of these skills here for each of these objects.

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:46,260
Or in other words, we're going to render a list of skills, right?

10
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:49,290
So I want you to create a similar array.

11
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:56,130
So with all your skills, then the level and also a color for each of these skills.

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,100
So that's your first task.

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,470
And then you simply loop over this list and display one skill for each of them.

14
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,880
Now here the level can be one of three different choices.

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,050
So either intermediate, advanced or beginner.

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,240
And so based on this level, I then want you to display one of these emojis.

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,620
So going back here, this is the emoji for the advanced.

18
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,240
This is for the intermediate and this is for the beginner level.

19
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:34,070
So basically you will conditionally set this emoji right here.

20
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:38,490
And yeah, that's basically all I want you to do for this challenge.

21
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,860
So please go ahead and pause the video now and I'll see you back here in a minute.

22
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:45,990
No.

23
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,620
Okay.

24
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:55,770
So let's come here to our skill list because that's where most of the difference will be.

25
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:03,720
So here what we did was to manually create one skill component for each of these skills.

26
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,710
Right.

27
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:12,030
But now we will get rid of all of this because now we will create a list of skills.

28
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:19,440
So we enter JavaScript mode and then we simply take our skills and use the map method.

29
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:24,630
So just like we did with the pizzas in our previous project.

30
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,270
So here in this map, each element of the array is one skill.

31
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,460
Of course, it could be any other variable name.

32
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:43,710
But anyway, so for each skill we want to create one skill component and let's first close it to avoid

33
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,670
the error and then we can pass in the props.

34
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:53,280
Now in the pizza project, we actually passed in the entire object as a prop, right?

35
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:59,130
But here, just for this to be a little bit different, let's actually pass them in one by one.

36
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,150
So the skill is going to be skill dot.

37
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,400
Skill.

38
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:11,170
So that's a lot of skills right there.

39
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,200
Like four times in a row.

40
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,860
Then next, let's pass in the color.

41
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,260
So that's skill dot color.

42
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,040
And then finally, we also have the level.

43
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:31,310
So that's at skill dot level.

44
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,830
Like, Oh.

45
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,820
That's it.

46
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:45,180
So you immediately see the difference down here because now we have six skills, so all the ones that

47
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,380
are in the array.

48
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:55,040
But we don't have the emojis yet because previously we were actively passing in an emoji prop, but

49
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,380
now we just pass in the level which we then want to convert to an emoji.

50
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:08,120
Right now, before we move on here, let's actually destructure the props just like we did also in the

51
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,930
project.

52
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,410
So that's skill color.

53
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,250
And level.

54
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:21,330
And again, this is so much useful like this because now we immediately know which data this component

55
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,470
here expects.

56
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,010
And of course, it also makes our code.

57
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,750
In here a little bit nicer.

58
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:34,920
So now we don't have the emoji variable here, of course.

59
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,680
And so instead, let's use the level for now.

60
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,290
Yeah, but now, again, we need to convert that.

61
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,960
So how are we going to do that?

62
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,140
Are we going to do conditional rendering or are we simply going to conditionally set the text here?

63
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,600
Well, I think it's best to just actually set the text conditionally.

64
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:04,170
Now, we cannot use a ternary operator because we don't have just two options, but three.

65
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,950
So it can be advanced, intermediate or beginner.

66
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:12,240
And so we actually are going to use now the end operator.

67
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,540
So let me show you what I mean by that.

68
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,590
So here, let's say level.

69
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,190
If it equals.

70
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,730
Beginner.

71
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:30,990
Then.

72
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:33,560
Well, let's just copy the emoji here.

73
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,730
It's like this, baby.

74
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:41,970
Then here the content should be this.

75
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:51,260
And so there it is for this one where I'm still at an advanced or actually at a at a beginner level.

76
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,590
And so now let's just use three of these.

77
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,120
Right.

78
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,760
And that's not a problem at all because these three are going to be mutually exclusive, so only one

79
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,620
of them will get applied.

80
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,410
Intermediate.

81
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,090
And advanced.

82
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,750
And now let's just grab the emojis here.

83
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,900
This one for advanced and.

84
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,870
This one for intermediate.

85
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,830
And there we go.

86
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,980
So here we conditionally set some text.

87
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:40,070
This time not using the ternary operator, but this time using the end operator and leveraging the property

88
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:43,010
of short circuiting that this operator has.

89
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,230
So for example, in this first one here level equals beginner is false.

90
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:53,630
And so then here false will be the result of this which does not get rendered.

91
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,720
Then the same here and then level equals advanced is actually true.

92
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,060
And so then the result of this operation will be this one.

93
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,570
So in the end, this is the content that we see here.

94
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,740
All right.

95
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,230
Now, you could have done it also in different ways.

96
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,200
That would have been no problem at all.

97
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:14,610
What matters is that somehow you got it to work.

98
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,800
It's not important how you did it.

99
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,110
Everyone can have different solutions here.

100
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,050
That's just completely normal.

101
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,580
Okay.

102
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:25,370
And so now that's actually a wrap.

103
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,350
So we finished this section.

104
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:36,140
And so once again, congratulations for reaching the end of this first Fundamentals of React section.

105
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:40,740
You already learned a lot and so you can be proud of yourself.

106
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:48,000
Next up, we are going to learn about the concept of state and of handling events so that we can finally

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,860
build some apps that are truly interactive.

108
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,700
So that's going to be amazing as we will build or really first useful project.

109
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:03,110
So a project that will not just display some data in the UI but with which we can also interact.

110
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,010
So that will be again a lot of fun and so don't waste any time.

111
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:12,570
And so if you have some time left, then let's immediately move on there.
