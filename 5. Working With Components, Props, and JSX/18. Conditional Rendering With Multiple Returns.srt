1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:09,000
The third way in which we can conditionally render some JS or some component is by using multiple returns.

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:17,700
So up until this point, all our components only ever had exactly one return keyword, right?

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:24,260
But there is nothing stopping us from adding another return keyword based on some condition.

4
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:32,030
So of course each component still can only return one block of JS, but that return can depend on a

5
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,780
condition.

6
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,060
So in other words, we can do, for example, this.

7
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:44,330
So right here we are outside of X, so we are simply inside the component.

8
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,080
And so here we can write any JavaScript we want.

9
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:50,270
So we can now easily use the If keyword.

10
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,230
So we can say if is not open.

11
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:56,320
Then return.

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,720
For example, this message right here.

13
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,340
So this.

14
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,570
So paste that here.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,880
And that's actually it.

16
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,930
So if the restaurant is not open, then this will be returned.

17
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:18,570
But if it is opened, then all of this here is not executed and then our normal return will simply be

18
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:19,500
executed.

19
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,270
What's important here is that these two returns cannot happen at the same time.

20
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:25,590
But that's right.

21
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,820
Now, in short, here.

22
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,940
So let's again put it to 20.

23
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,660
And so now we get this.

24
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,310
It's exactly this message right here.

25
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,170
So it's not coming from here.

26
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,690
So we could replace this.

27
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,170
But I will leave it here and I will explain in a second why.

28
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,520
But anyway, now this is actually coming from here.

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:57,270
And we could, of course, do anything here just to make sure it is really coming from there.

30
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:05,310
And yeah, now, the problem in this case is that we are now no longer rendering the filter element

31
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,010
around this pier.

32
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:13,200
So if we wanted to do the exact same thing, we would also have to copy the filter here, right?

33
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,730
Otherwise the filter would only be rendered in case the restaurant is open.

34
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:20,970
But if not, then no filter would exist.

35
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:24,600
So this is actually, in this case, not what we want.

36
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,650
All right.

37
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:33,880
So usually this early return, like we did here, is more useful when we want to render entire components

38
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,150
conditionally, but not just some pieces of JSX.

39
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:42,330
So let's try something else here, maybe.

40
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,440
And what I'm looking for is actually this pizza component.

41
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,620
So remember how the pizza has a property of sold out?

42
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,050
So we can see that here in the props.

43
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,840
So each pizza receives.

44
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,320
This pizza object now as a prop and then we have sold out.

45
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,430
So what we can do here as an early return is to say.

46
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:08,280
If.

47
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,490
Props dot pizza object.

48
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,740
Dot sold out.

49
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:17,860
Then return nothing.

50
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:24,430
And so with this, then the pizza that is sold out will not appear on the user interface.

51
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,550
And indeed, there was one pizza.

52
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:32,080
So that's this one here, pizza Salamino.

53
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,220
And that's no longer here now.

54
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,910
And so that's because here we have this early return.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,210
So that's sometimes a pretty common technique that we can use, which is to simply return null.

56
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,770
So nothing in case there is a certain condition that's true.

57
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,320
And so in this case, this can be quite useful.

58
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,240
So for now, let's leave this here.

59
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:57,470
Even though later we will do something even nicer with this property.

60
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:04,880
So as a conclusion of these three lectures on conditional rendering, my recommendation is to use the

61
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:10,700
ternary operator whenever you need to return some piece of JSX based on a condition.

62
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:14,030
So just for example, like this here.

63
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:20,450
So this we are going to use all the time, but also sometimes you just want to do something like this.

64
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:26,900
So you want to return something entirely different, no matter if that's nothing or if that's just some

65
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,070
other component.

66
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,820
So for example, we could also say here something that doesn't make any sense.

67
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,510
But let's just try this.

68
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,840
So we could do this.

69
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:43,050
So in case it sold out, we return the header in this place.

70
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,090
So again here, that makes no sense at all, but that would be a possibility.

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,530
Although not a very good one.

72
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:57,040
So throughout this course you will learn which of these options is the best simply by practicing and

73
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,340
using them in different situations over and over again.
