1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:08,160
Welcome to the very first coding challenge of this course, where you will now for the first time practice

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,390
all the skills that you have already learned in this course on your own.

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:20,470
So the goal of this challenge is to build a developer profile card just like this one.

4
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,320
So we have like an avatar image here.

5
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:29,890
Then the name of the developer, a short bio, and finally a list of skills.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,140
Now to actually build this project, you have two options.

7
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:41,410
First, you can simply create a new Create React app on your own computer and then build the project

8
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,430
there, just like we have been doing in this section.

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:52,210
Or second, you can use the CodeSandbox app that we used for the very first app that we built in the

10
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:52,870
course.

11
00:00:52,870 --> 00:01:00,610
So this is basically an online editor, which makes it very easy to quickly try out some new small projects.

12
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:04,510
And so this is what I'm actually going to use to build this challenge.

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,600
Now, in case you want to do the same, I advise you to create a new account here and then once you're

14
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,630
done, you can simply create a new react app here.

15
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,770
So just click up here to create and then react.

16
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,530
And again, maybe by the time you're watching this, CodeSandbox looks completely different.

17
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:28,520
But just find the button somewhere to create a new React app.

18
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:37,010
Or alternatively, as I showed you also before, you can simply do React dot new and this will then

19
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:45,620
also scaffold a new React app and actually it does use under the hood also create React app.

20
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,740
It's a bit different here in terms of the file structure.

21
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:54,620
But yeah, it also allows us to very quickly build a small React app.

22
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:01,730
Now before you actually start coding, I have a few pieces of advice for you because this probably seems

23
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,780
a bit daunting.

24
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:09,110
So building all of this here from scratch as a complete beginner might be a bit difficult.

25
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,210
So let me give you a few hints.

26
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,460
So here I already have basically the app component.

27
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,430
And so let's together look at the structure here.

28
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,170
So in this app we return a div with the class name of Cart.

29
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:32,010
And by the way, you can get all of these styles right here from this file which is available at this

30
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,820
URL.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,980
So at this starter for this challenge, which of course I will attach to the lecture on Udemy as always.

32
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,290
So make sure to check out that link and from there you can then get this CSS.

33
00:02:47,990 --> 00:02:54,530
But anyway, going back here, what I want you to do is to create this div, which is the entire cart.

34
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,760
So basically the container for all this with this black border.

35
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,680
And then in there we have an avatar component, which will be for the image.

36
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,470
And then we have this div for the data.

37
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,170
Then in the data we have the intro, which is for this heading here and for this bio.

38
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:16,540
And then we have here a list of skills.

39
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,120
So a component called skill list.

40
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,410
And in the skill list you should have one skill component for each web development skill that you have.

41
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,700
And in order to customize each of these skills, you will use props.

42
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,130
So just as we learned previously.

43
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:41,230
So going back here, for example, I created one skill for each of these six web dev skills that I have,

44
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:48,610
and so into each of them I passed the skill itself, then the emoji here, and then also the background

45
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,270
color.

46
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,380
And this background color is probably the most challenging part here.

47
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,530
So maybe don't worry too much about that part.

48
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,870
What matters to me here is that you pass in the emoji and the skill name itself.

49
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:09,740
And so basically with that you can already customize the skill component pretty nicely.

50
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:16,850
Now as for the image, you can actually upload the image so your avatar image or any other image that

51
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:20,110
you wish right here into code Sandbox.

52
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,960
So you can just open this public folder and then drag and drop an image right into this.

53
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:31,820
So this will then upload the image right into the sandbox and you can then reference that image just

54
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,570
like we have been doing in our app throughout this section.

55
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,620
Okay.

56
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:43,520
And I think these instructions should get you going and in case you need some more, then you can just

57
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,500
start watching my solution.

58
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,540
That is of course no problem at all.

59
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:53,990
It's really, really no problem if you're not able to do all of this on your own, on your first try.

60
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,890
So if you need to watch my solution, that's 100% fine.

61
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,950
Now make sure also to read here through this styles.css, because this will then give you the hints

62
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,830
for which class names you should use.

63
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,400
For example, for the Avatar image, this is the class that you need here for the skills list and so

64
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,940
on.

65
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,190
So please go ahead, pause the video now and then.

66
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,510
Do as much as you can.

67
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:26,240
And once you're done with that, I will meet you back here with my solution.

68
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:31,680
And probably I should leave this one here up on the screen so you can see what you actually need to

69
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,280
build.

70
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,550
So good luck with that and see you in a minute.

71
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,290
Okay.

72
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,030
So how did you do?

73
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Well, let's try to tackle this one together.

74
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,180
So I'm creating here a brand new React app.

75
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,290
So the one that I actually created before with React New.

76
00:05:52,470 --> 00:06:00,840
And then let's get rid of this file here as we will once again do it all inside Index.js.

77
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,480
Okay, so let's create.

78
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,130
The app component right here.

79
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,970
And actually just to make it a bit quicker, I will already.

80
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,170
Uh, copy and the code that I already had before.

81
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,560
So this way we're speeding up the video a little bit.

82
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,080
So just like this.

83
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,830
And I will also, of course, get these starter styles.

84
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:39,610
Okay.

85
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,480
And so now let's just create these additional components.

86
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,620
So function avatar.

87
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,270
Then the intro.

88
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:57,610
And finally, also the.

89
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,260
Skill list and the skill itself.

90
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:09,300
So again, we're going to have one skill component for each of our web development skills.

91
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,150
And now let's start with the easiest one.

92
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:19,090
So the avatar is basically just an image with a source.

93
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:26,050
Let's leave this one empty for now and let's add the alt tag with my name.

94
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,850
Okay.

95
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,180
And now let's grab the image and drag and drop it here.

96
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,340
So I have it in my downloads folder.

97
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:41,420
So this will quickly upload the file and then I can just write here in the source.

98
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,720
Jonas Dot J.

99
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,720
Pack.

100
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,800
So if I save this now, then let's see if something happens.

101
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,460
Well.

102
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:57,710
We have some errors here, so let's just reload this internal browser.

103
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,050
Let's just fix it.

104
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:02,000
And there we go.

105
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,920
So this is way too large.

106
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,930
And that's simply because I forgot the appropriate class name here.

107
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,930
So that's just class name.

108
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,440
Avatar.

109
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:17,980
Yeah.

110
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:18,970
Beautiful.

111
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:22,390
So that's already our first part right there.

112
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,610
It's just closed down.

113
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,250
Yeah, just like that.

114
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,410
So next up, we have the intro.

115
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,060
Which is just some div here.

116
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:40,990
And then.

117
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,480
One primary heading.

118
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,180
And then here with a paragraph for the bio.

119
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,760
And here I will just grab it from here.

120
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,130
And of course you are hopefully going to write your own one.

121
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,270
Give it a safe.

122
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,870
So that's the next part.

123
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:10,080
And now here comes the hardest part, which is the skill list.

124
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,600
So before we tackle the skill list, let's actually build the skill itself.

125
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,910
So return.

126
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:30,670
It's a div with the class name of skill and hopefully you got this one simply by looking at the CSS

127
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,390
file.

128
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,700
Let's close it.

129
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,820
And for now, let's just write something in here.

130
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,410
And also just some emoji.

131
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,170
Okay.

132
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,130
And then.

133
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,930
Let's hear also create a div.

134
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:02,210
And if I'm going a bit too fast for you, it's simply because I don't want this video to take forever.

135
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,380
Okay.

136
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:09,740
And I will also explain the important parts, of course, after the code is written.

137
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:16,110
But anyway, we see that we already included or very first skill right here.

138
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:24,180
However, if I now copy and paste this, then we have the same problem as we had before with our pizzas,

139
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,090
which is that they are all the same.

140
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:32,610
And so now we need to again reach for props in order to customize these skills.

141
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,910
So into the skills component.

142
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,760
Let's pass in a prop called skill.

143
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,210
And I will call it react.

144
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,780
And then let's also pass in an emoji.

145
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,430
So this one, for example.

146
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,310
Okay.

147
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,940
And now here, just like before we receive the props object.

148
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,430
So as an argument or as a parameter to this skill's component function.

149
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:12,420
And so here we can now use exactly that.

150
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,680
So let's maybe actually create one span.

151
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:22,390
So one element for the skill itself and then one for the emoji.

152
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,590
So here all we have to do is to now write props.

153
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:34,690
So props again is that object that react will automatically pass into the component when we define some

154
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,740
props on it.

155
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:43,120
And so now we have on props, props, skill and prop dot emoji, because these are the two props that

156
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,620
we passed in right here.

157
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:53,770
So again, think of a prop as a communication channel between this skill list component, which is calling

158
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:58,960
so, which is including this skill component and the child component.

159
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,160
So the component itself.

160
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:06,190
So these two can now basically communicate by passing in some data.

161
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:09,740
But anyway, let's now use this prop.

162
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,290
So props dot skill.

163
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,240
And then let's use.

164
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,250
Another span here.

165
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,970
For props.

166
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,310
Dot emoji.

167
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,490
And let's see what happens.

168
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,820
So we have the skill.

169
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,690
But here.

170
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,890
Of course, that cannot work.

171
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,990
And there we go.

172
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,490
Beautiful.

173
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,590
So let's keep going.

174
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,900
So let's say skill.

175
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:44,990
HTML.

176
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:46,530
Plus.

177
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,440
And the emoji, let's say, is the same.

178
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,520
So also some strong skills right there.

179
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:58,410
And so now, indeed, we got two different components here.

180
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,740
So two skill components with different data.

181
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:05,200
And now let's add just another skill.

182
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,840
What do we have here?

183
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:15,850
So we have, uh, let's say svelte then with this baby emoji because, well, I'm not very good at svelte.

184
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,580
I just tried it out once for a few hours.

185
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:23,770
So I can say that I'm good with svelte.

186
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,380
All right.

187
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:35,120
Here, we actually need to add the class name of skill list, I believe.

188
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,210
Yeah.

189
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,690
This then places them nicely side by side.

190
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,100
And let's actually just add one more.

191
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,880
Just so they wrap onto the next line.

192
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,210
Let's say JavaScript here.

193
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:52,480
All right.

194
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,390
So we are already almost done here.

195
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:02,470
So the only thing that is missing and which I told you is not really mandatory because it is quite confusing,

196
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,170
is the background color here?

197
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,540
So how do we do the background color?

198
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:13,640
Well, first of all, I will pass in a string with the name of the color.

199
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,210
So let's call that prop color.

200
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,060
And then for react, the color that I want.

201
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,610
While I'm not really sure, let's just use blue.

202
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:29,500
So it could, of course, also do some hexadecimal value right here.

203
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,090
So Will just leave that there for now.

204
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,180
So HTML, CSS.

205
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:41,440
Let's do orange red for this one.

206
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,320
Then here.

207
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,490
Yellow.

208
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,880
And while svelte is also kind of orange.

209
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,770
So let's do that.

210
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,800
Okay, so we passed in a color.

211
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,090
Now it's time to use it here.

212
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:04,010
So what we want to do is to add it here as a background color.

213
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,940
So basically we want to add an individual style to each of these skill components.

214
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,470
And do you remember how we can do that?

215
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:21,150
Well, we can just use the style property or actually the style prop as we now know it is called.

216
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,540
So each of these is called a prop even here.

217
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,750
So like even this class name in JSX and also this style is called a prop.

218
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:38,090
So we enter JavaScript mode and then we create an object with the property of.

219
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,960
Background color.

220
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,640
And then here all we do is to use that prop that we passed in.

221
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:48,890
So that's props, Dot.

222
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,710
Color.

223
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:54,070
Give it a safe and beautiful.

224
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:56,950
So that worked.

225
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,180
So maybe you also got this.

226
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,250
And if you did, then really congratulations.

227
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,240
This year was the trickiest part.

228
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:11,270
But my main concern here was actually to get you writing these components here on your own and have

229
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:17,450
all of them return some JSX and then of course, apply your new knowledge about props.

230
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:23,170
So having these two components here basically communicate with one another.

231
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:27,740
So this is really, really important that you understood what is happening here.

232
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,050
Just make this a little bit prettier here.

233
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:33,970
Let's do it.

234
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,600
Actually, this one orange and this other one orange.

235
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,380
Red.

236
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:43,980
And even though these colors are not perfect, there are at least a bit better than they were before.

237
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:45,120
All right.

238
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,200
So hopefully you found this challenge useful and hopefully it helped you really to understand this concept

239
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,420
of props here even better.

240
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:00,390
And again, if for some reason you weren't able to do all of this on your own, then please, really,

241
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:01,590
really don't worry.

242
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:08,190
There's plenty of time to learn all of this stuff throughout the course and I'm 100% that by the end

243
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:15,330
of it, or even after a few sections already, you will start to get really good at React.

244
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:22,560
But now let's keep going and keep learning about some more fundamental react principles and techniques.
