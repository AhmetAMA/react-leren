1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:07,250
From now on, you will start coding on your own computer and it's pretty much guaranteed that errors

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:10,790
will happen and that some things simply won't work.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:18,140
And so right off the bat, I want to show you a few techniques for dealing with these errors and problems.

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,120
So this is a really important lecture, so please don't skip it.

5
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:30,340
So let's say that you're doing some change here in your code and save it and then you want to see the

6
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:31,050
output.

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:35,200
But imagine that for some reason your page didn't update here.

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,090
So what do you do?

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,780
So when that happens, don't panic, but instead try out a few solutions which will tell you now.

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:49,210
And the first one is to make sure that the application is actually running.

11
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,750
And believe me or not, this has actually happened to me before.

12
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:59,470
So I thought the app should be running and I was doing some updates to the code changing something and

13
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:02,170
I was wondering why the app was not reloading.

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:09,910
But then at some point I noticed that, well, I actually hadn't even started the app, so this is actually

15
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:11,170
something that can happen.

16
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,470
So if you don't have the app running, of course.

17
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:21,730
So if you didn't use NPM, start like I showed you earlier, then, well, of course your app cannot

18
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:27,650
reload in the browser, but if you're sure that it is actually running but still not updating, then

19
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:31,820
one solution can be to stop the app and restart it.

20
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,370
So here is the tab in the terminal where I currently have the app running.

21
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,300
And so in order to stop it, we use control C.

22
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:48,300
So on the Mac, that's Control C and on Windows, it's also just control C, Then on Windows, I think

23
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,490
it might ask you if you actually want to stop and then you can just type Y and hit enter.

24
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,420
So with this you have it stopped and then you can restart.

25
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,870
So that's then again, npm start.

26
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,100
Which then open up a new tab.

27
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:06,920
And yeah, there we go.

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,860
And so, yeah, here it is.

29
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,890
And if I change something now, then it should be reflected immediately.

30
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,810
So there it is.

31
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:23,170
And actually, it's more common than you might think that you have to do these kinds of things.

32
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,490
And that's why I really wanted to include this lecture early on.

33
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:33,800
And what's also pretty common is that sometimes all you have to do is to do a hard reload here in the

34
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,310
browser.

35
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:41,570
So just click this reloading button because this automatic reload, so the hot module replacement actually

36
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:43,820
breaks all the time for some reason.

37
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,960
And so then one of the solutions is to just hard reload the browser.

38
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:53,990
Now another good tip that I can give you is to always keep the terminal open here at all times, and

39
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,790
the same here for the dev tools.

40
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,270
Uh, in the browser.

41
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,600
Well, it's not so inspecting.

42
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,200
And then here, that's a bit too big.

43
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:06,420
Yeah.

44
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,760
Then here having the console open.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,100
Also there's something called the React Dev Tools, but we will talk about that a little bit later.

46
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:20,560
So it's good to keep these open because then in case there are some unexpected errors, they will show

47
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,890
up here in this console and also down here.

48
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:28,750
And also, if you have this open, you can always be sure that the app is running.

49
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:34,960
You can just maybe make it a little bit smaller because, well, the window here is so small already.

50
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:37,600
Otherwise, we almost can't see our code.

51
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,080
Now, I was talking about error messages before, and so sometimes these appear when you do something

52
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,690
wrong.

53
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:52,870
So create React app actually has some internal thing which will automatically display errors right here

54
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,560
on top.

55
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,420
So like on top on the window.

56
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,080
And also all of here, we show that to you.

57
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,000
So I will just write something here which will create an error.

58
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:07,440
And so indeed, we have the error here.

59
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,430
Well, actually not here.

60
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,640
But sometimes important errors do pop up here.

61
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,070
But we have this overlay over the entire app which gives us this error message.

62
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:24,490
And so it's a good idea to then take a look at this error message and maybe try to understand what exactly

63
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,330
went wrong.

64
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,690
So usually this first part here is not really important.

65
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:34,150
But then here it tells us adjacent elements must be wrapped in an enclosing tag.

66
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,700
Did you want a fragment?

67
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:43,060
And maybe if you don't really understand this, you can just take this copy, open a new tab and Google

68
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,610
it.

69
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,240
And so this is now the power of React.

70
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:53,230
Huge community because hundreds, if not thousands of people before you have had the same problem and

71
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:58,120
have Googled it or have like asked a question on StackOverflow.

72
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,670
And so you will find your answer there.

73
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,340
So this one is a little bit older.

74
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,490
I saw earlier it's from 20.

75
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,980
16.

76
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:09,370
Yeah.

77
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,850
So you should usually find something a bit more recent.

78
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,980
Like this one here from 2020.

79
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,250
But yeah, so here we are, not trying to solve a specific problem.

80
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:25,490
I was just mentioning that it's many times a good idea to google these error messages right here.

81
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,750
So in this case, it's really not allowed to return more than one element.

82
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,970
So here we are returning the H one and the P, and that's not allowed in React.

83
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,140
So just delete that and then the error will disappear.

84
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,760
Another important tip is to always work with Eslint.

85
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:48,120
So Eslint is enabled by default.

86
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:56,820
For example, if you do this like const X equals Jonas and give it a save, then immediately you get

87
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,900
this warning here.

88
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:04,170
So then you can hover and it will warn you that X is declared, but its value is never read.

89
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:11,010
And this is just one of countless examples and situations in which Eslint can warn you that you're about

90
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:12,810
to do something that you're not supposed to.

91
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:19,140
Because if you have a variable that you're not using, it means that probably somewhere else you declared

92
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,110
the wrong variable that you actually didn't want to.

93
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,860
Right.

94
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:30,010
And by the way, these problems, they also appear down here in this problems tab.

95
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,440
So this is also very useful down here.

96
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:38,160
So whenever you have some issue like this, so these yellow lines under some of your code, you should

97
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,740
probably check out what's going on there.

98
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:46,590
Now we're talking here about this tabs down here.

99
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:50,820
Sometimes the prettier extension stops working for some reason.

100
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:55,590
And when that happens, it's a good idea to come here to this output tab.

101
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:01,080
And then here you can select one of these processes that is running inside your VS code.

102
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,530
For example, as I was saying, prettier.

103
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:13,550
So here it looks as if everything is working fine, but sometimes it will show you an error here and

104
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,250
then you can try to fix that.

105
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,590
And the same is true for Eslint.

106
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,450
So if you notice that Eslint for some reason stopped working, you can come here and check out if there

107
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,560
is any problem.

108
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,510
So this here even looks as though there is some problem.

109
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,520
Yeah, there was an error here, but.

110
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,910
Well, it still works.

111
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,960
So, yeah, we don't need to worry about that in this case.

112
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,500
Okay, But let's come back to our terminal, which is the one that we want open most of the time.

113
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:52,340
So if everything looks correct in your code and if you did everything that I told you, but still your

114
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:58,400
code is not working, it probably means that you have some bug in your code because it is different

115
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,570
than the one that I'm showing you in the video.

116
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:07,130
And so in that case, the best thing to do is to open up the final code for each of the projects.

117
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:14,360
So the one that we downloaded in the beginning and then simply try to compare that with my code and

118
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,100
doing so should then enable you to find the bug that you have in your code.

119
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:26,570
And speaking of bugs, actually I introduced a bug here in this render part here.

120
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,570
So the way that we render it before React 18 remember is this react dot render.

121
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:38,090
But nowhere we are telling here where to render the app component.

122
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:45,290
So again, we need to select that root element and actually place that here as a second argument.

123
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,540
So just to fix this here.

124
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:54,120
But again, you are not going to write this yourself, but maybe you will work on an older code base

125
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,600
at some point, which uses an older version of React.

126
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,290
And so then this is how that project will render the root element into your application.

127
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:10,200
And by the way, you can see which React version you're using right here in the dependencies array.

128
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,420
And so in this case we are using React 18.2, or at least I am.

129
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:21,030
So if you're watching this far in the future, then probably some other version has already come out.

130
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:27,720
But all of this, what we're talking about here will of course apply to probably most of the future

131
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,530
versions.

132
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:31,130
And that's actually it.

133
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:38,210
So that's the list of tips that I have for you for dealing with problems that will sooner or later arrive

134
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,760
as you start writing your own React applications and even while you follow this course.
