1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:07,620
It's time to introduce yet another fundamental react concept, which is perhaps.

2
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:16,470
And props is essentially how we pass data between components and in particular from parent components

3
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:18,420
to child components.

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,830
So we can imagine props as being like a communication channel between a parent and a child component.

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,000
So in practice, what we're going to do is to now customize each of these pizza components that we have

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,110
right here.

7
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:41,910
So remember how we created the pizza component, which has this image, the pizza name and the ingredients.

8
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:49,110
But right now, all of the pizzas are the same because, well, we didn't have a way of passing different

9
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:52,420
data into them to make each of them customized.

10
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,460
But now, as we learned about props, we will be able to do that.

11
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,680
So first of all, let's.

12
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:07,190
Grab or pizza component and cut it from here and place it right after the menu.

13
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,470
Just so we can see what's happening.

14
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,970
And then let's get rid of this repetition here for now.

15
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,670
So we only want this one pizza component here for now.

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,780
Okay.

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:26,860
And so now it's time to pass the data from this parent component here, which is the menu in this case,

18
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,260
to the pizza component.

19
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,380
So what we want to pass is basically this string right here.

20
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:40,030
So the link to the image, then the name of the pizza and the ingredients.

21
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:43,150
So to define props, we do it in two steps.

22
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:50,320
First, we pass the props into the component and then second, we receive the props in the component

23
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,090
that we pass them into.

24
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,310
So here is where we pass those props in and we write them just like this.

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,530
So just as if they were normal attributes.

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,030
So.

27
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,470
Pizza Spinazzi.

28
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,670
That's the first one.

29
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,450
Then.

30
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:14,180
Let's also define a prop for the ingredient.

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,250
And by the way, Prop simply stands for property.

32
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,810
It's just a short for.

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,670
Yeah, property.

34
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:25,440
No.

35
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,130
Okay.

36
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,500
And then finally, let's say the photo or photo name.

37
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,630
And then let's grab this one here.

38
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:38,820
All right.

39
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,340
And maybe let's also pass in a price.

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,900
And for now I will also pass it as a string.

41
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,150
But I will show you something in a minute.

42
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,700
So for now, just write it like this.

43
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:56,040
Give it a save and then prettier will format everything nicely like this.

44
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,550
And now we need to go to the second step, which is to actually receive the props here inside the child

45
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,430
component.

46
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:09,540
So right now, of course, the component has no way of knowing that these four props have been passed

47
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,050
in.

48
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,590
So the way we do that is to accept a props parameter here in this component.

49
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:24,210
And then for starters, let's just lock this props to the console and take a look at what's happening.

50
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,870
And we already can see something here.

51
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:32,450
So this props is basically this object right here.

52
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:37,520
And it has name, then pizza spinach, which is exactly this.

53
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:42,730
So what happened as React included this pizza component?

54
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,610
It basically called this function and passed in this props object.

55
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:53,640
And this props object is made out of these four props that we passed into the component.

56
00:03:54,260 --> 00:04:00,080
And so now we can use this props object to replace all of these values here.

57
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:08,380
Now we need to take these values out of the object and therefore we need JavaScript, right?

58
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,270
So here, this is no longer a string, but we need to enter JavaScript node again.

59
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:18,270
So props dot photo name is this one.

60
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,350
Then here it is, the name of the pizza.

61
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,200
And again we need JavaScript mode.

62
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,200
So props dot name.

63
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,260
The same thing down here.

64
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,770
So props dot name.

65
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,720
And finally, down here, we want props, dot ingredients.

66
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,640
Or actually it's ingredient.

67
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:50,110
Let's fix that here.

68
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,440
Ingredients and ingredients down here.

69
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,030
Okay.

70
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:01,510
And of course, now everything still looks the same because the data that we had here before is exactly

71
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,390
the data that we have here.

72
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,760
But now let's actually make some magic happen.

73
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,400
So let's create another pizza component.

74
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,560
And then this is where we will see why props are so useful.

75
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,310
So let's create a pizza Funghi.

76
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,980
Let's give it some ingredients.

77
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:31,720
So tomato, let's say, also mushrooms.

78
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,390
And this is not important here.

79
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,380
This is just to show you that we can now fully customize our components.

80
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,050
Next, we can define the price and notice that I'm doing it now in a different order.

81
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,910
So here I had first the photo name, then the price.

82
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:53,820
And this is just to show you that the order in which we pass in the props is completely irrelevant.

83
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:02,930
So photo name is pizzas slash fungi dot j pack.

84
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:04,940
Okay.

85
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:09,050
And now we need to immediately close this component just like before.

86
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,990
And as I save it, watch what happened here.

87
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:18,550
And there is our second pizza component now with completely different data.

88
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,770
And so now for the first time, we have reused a component and configured it in a way that makes each

89
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,220
component unique and display their own data.

90
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,390
Okay.

91
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:33,710
And now let's just improve this pizza component here a little bit.

92
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,810
So for starters, in our CSS, we actually have a class name here.

93
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:42,340
So a class name called pizza.

94
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:44,060
Now.

95
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:44,450
Okay.

96
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:52,070
And then let's also place these two here inside their own div so that the data can be displayed at the

97
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,630
side of the image.

98
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,060
So just like here in our original.

99
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,520
So this is what we're going for.

100
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,380
So here we have.

101
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,670
A div.

102
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,830
And then again I'm using that trick where I simply push down that line.

103
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,710
And this is already looking a lot nicer.

104
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,980
Let's just finally also add the price here.

105
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,320
And I'm doing that as a span.

106
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,780
So props.

107
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,180
Dot price.

108
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,190
And there it is.

109
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:31,260
But now let's say that we wanted for some reason to add a number here.

110
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:35,580
So we wanted to increase all the prices by three, let's say.

111
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,910
But what what happens when we try this?

112
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,230
So all the prices plus three.

113
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:51,930
So what happens is that react or JavaScript basically simply added the three here to the end of this

114
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:52,500
number.

115
00:07:52,500 --> 00:08:00,270
And the reason for that is that here we pass these numbers actually in as a string and we can see that

116
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,250
also here in this output.

117
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,220
So we do not want a string here.

118
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,930
Instead, we want a number.

119
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:11,340
And so the way we can achieve that is by entering again JavaScript mode.

120
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:17,100
And so in JavaScript this is now an actual number and so watch what happens.

121
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,800
Indeed, now we have 13, which is the ten we had before plus three.

122
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
Okay, then let's do the same thing here.

123
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:30,430
And that fixes this.

124
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:36,050
So this is very important to notice that whenever you want to pass in something that is not a string,

125
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:43,610
you just use, again, this JavaScript mode basically because in fact you can pass in anything as a

126
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,150
prop.

127
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,580
So it doesn't have to be a string or a number.

128
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,980
You can pass in arrays or objects or even other react components.

129
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:59,120
So props is really, really powerful and really one of the most fundamental things in React.

130
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,750
And now to review this concept and to go even a bit further, let's move on to the next lecture.
