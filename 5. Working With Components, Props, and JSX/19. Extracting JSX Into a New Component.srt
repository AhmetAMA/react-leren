1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:06,480
Now to practice the concepts of components and using props just a little bit more.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,060
Let's extract parts of the footer into a new component.

3
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:18,720
So the DJs here inside the footer component is getting a little bit too long.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,910
And so I got the idea of taking this part here and extracting it into its own component.

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:31,800
So let's grab all of this and cut it, and then we're simply going to create a new component.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,280
So we write function.

7
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:36,440
Let's call it order.

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,410
And then all we have to do is to just return that JS that we just created.

9
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:51,650
All right now prettier did not format this because actually our code is wrong now because here we don't

10
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,070
have anything as the first value in the ternary operator.

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,080
So let's immediately fix that.

12
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:05,690
So instead of that JS that we had here before, now what we want is to simply render the order component.

13
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,080
So order.

14
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,370
And that's actually it.

15
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,520
Now React is still not happy with us.

16
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:20,830
And that's because down here close our is of course no longer defined.

17
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:27,700
And it makes sense because close our is only defined here inside the footer component.

18
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:34,030
But now the JSX that we had here before is gone and it is in the order component.

19
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,100
So how do we give this order component access to this value right here?

20
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,170
And I hope that you guessed that the answer is by using props.

21
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:51,770
So as we see here, props is actually also quite similar to passing arguments into functions.

22
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,690
So all we have to do here is to create a prop.

23
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:03,930
So let's say open our so we can just give it exactly the same name as the variable.

24
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,810
So it doesn't have to be like this.

25
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,980
But it can.

26
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,310
And so then here let's receive props as a parameter.

27
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,500
And then we can simply read close our from there.

28
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:24,900
And again, this works because we made the prop here exactly the same name as the variable.

29
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:30,540
So if it was prop hours, then here, of course we would also have to use that.

30
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,160
Right.

31
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,430
But what matters is that it's working just fine.

32
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,660
Well, actually, we are not seeing the result there.

33
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,860
So let's set it back to 12.

34
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,220
And so now, yeah, we're getting the order component rendered there.

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:54,670
However, we see that here is a problem and I notice that's because I actually created a bug.

36
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,030
So here we have closed hours.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,870
But what we passed in is actually open hours.

38
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,300
So we're not interested in open but in close.

39
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:13,800
So this should be close our and here close our and here also close our as we had before.

40
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:18,750
And so now that's fixed and so that's actually it.

41
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:25,780
So this is how we take a piece of JSX when the JSX in a component is getting a little bit too big and

42
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,600
simply extract it into its own component.

43
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,690
And then if that JSX depends on some value that was in the parent component.

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,830
So like this close our then we simply pass it in as a prop.

45
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,690
And so this is something that we're going to do all the time when we build our React applications.

46
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:49,510
So not always do we have all the components figured out in the beginning, but instead we start building

47
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:56,500
them and then when they get too big, we can decide to extract part of them into just another component.

48
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:02,940
And now, since this was the last component that we're going to create in this project, I invite you

49
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,850
to take a pen and a paper and to draw out the entire component tree that we just built here.

50
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:16,980
So I think that's going to be a nice small exercise for you to get a better hold of how all the components

51
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,990
in this application work together.

52
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:25,050
And yeah, really understand the structure that we built here for this small project.

53
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,520
And then once you're done with that, you can just simply move on to the next lecture.
