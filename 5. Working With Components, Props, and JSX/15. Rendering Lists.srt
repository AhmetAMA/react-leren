1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:08,330
Rendering lists is one of the most common things that we do in basically all React applications.

2
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:12,580
You will probably do it like 100 times throughout this course.

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,690
And so let's now learn how to render lists in React.

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,110
But first of all, what do we actually mean by rendering lists?

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:28,650
Well, basically, rendering a list is when we have an array and we want to create one component for

6
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,660
each element of the array.

7
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,800
So, for example, here we have our starter data.

8
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,940
Remember?

9
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:41,730
So here we have an array of these objects where each object is one pizza.

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,650
And so as you can imagine, now we want to basically render this list.

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,170
So basically we want to take this array.

12
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:56,310
And for each of these pizza objects, we want to automatically create one pizza component here in our

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,600
user interface.

14
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:06,530
So instead of calling or of using here the pizza component manually one by one, we want to do it all

15
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,170
at once, dynamically.

16
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,210
So if we have like four pizzas in the array, then we want four components to be rendered.

17
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:21,170
But if we have like 6 or 10, then we want ten components to show up here in our app.

18
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,530
Okay, so let's now learn how to do this.

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,610
Now the beauty of React is that for many things, all we need really is the JavaScript knowledge that

20
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,960
we already have.

21
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,480
So, for example, for rendering lists, there's nothing new about react that we need to learn.

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,580
So it doesn't give us like a list element that we can use or something like this.

23
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:51,690
All we need is the JavaScript knowledge that we already have, and in this case all we need is the map

24
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:52,470
method.

25
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:57,010
So let me show you how after all this talk.

26
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,350
So let's create a new div here.

27
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,640
And later we will convert this to an actual list element.

28
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,460
But let's just start out with any element here.

29
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,260
It doesn't really matter which one.

30
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,580
And for starters, let's also comment out this code right here.

31
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:22,420
And maybe you noticed here, by the way, that a comment in JS is simply again entering JavaScript mode.

32
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,040
So with these curly braces and then this is just a JavaScript comment.

33
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:34,430
So this is one of the rules of JS that was actually in one of the slides or actually in the only slide

34
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,810
in the previous lecture.

35
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:39,710
So if you read that then you're already familiar with this.

36
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,480
But anyway, let's now render our pizza list.

37
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,430
Let's remember.

38
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,900
Yeah, it's called pizza data.

39
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:58,680
So let's enter a JavaScript mode here and then let's take our pizza data which remember is just an array

40
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,760
and then.

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,670
Let's map over it.

42
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:07,740
So with map, we basically loop over this array and create a brand new array.

43
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,090
So in this pizza data, each element is a pizza.

44
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,530
So let's do this and what we want in this new array.

45
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:25,060
So in the new array that will be the result of map is for each pizza, a pizza component.

46
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:30,280
And now we can simply pass all of these props in dynamically here.

47
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,040
Let's first close it like this.

48
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:42,680
So we can now say pizza dot and I think it is name but let's check.

49
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,400
Yeah.

50
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,110
So we have name ingredients, price photo data and even this other property.

51
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:54,650
So if I give it a save right now, we should already see the six components over there.

52
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,950
And indeed.

53
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,900
Beautiful.

54
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,950
There they are.

55
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,120
They are missing here the image and the prices, I guess.

56
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,760
But in principle, it's already working.

57
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,790
So you see here that we now get these console logs here for each of the pizzas.

58
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,660
Exactly.

59
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,220
With the names we have here.

60
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:23,440
And so now we are effectively already rendering a list, so a list based on this pizza data.

61
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:31,960
Now, we could keep going here and basically add another property now for the photo name, for example.

62
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:39,050
So we can do pizza dot photo name and so on and so forth.

63
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,560
But usually this is not how we do it.

64
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:47,640
Usually what we do is to pass in the entire object into the more specific component.

65
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,450
So that's pizza in this case.

66
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:56,950
And then inside of that component, we would then take the information that we want out of the object.

67
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,890
So let's now change the way we pass props into this pizza and simply pass.

68
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:12,420
Pizza and let's maybe say pizza object just to make it slightly less confusing and then or JavaScript

69
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:12,990
mode.

70
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,950
And then the current pizza object.

71
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:18,670
All right.

72
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,820
And now it all breaks here because we need to adapt.

73
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,260
Of course, our pizza.

74
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,840
So now here we have props.

75
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,830
Dot pizza object Dot Photo name.

76
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,490
Right.

77
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,570
And so let's.

78
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,690
Paste this here.

79
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,900
Everywhere.

80
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,100
And here.

81
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,650
And here and here.

82
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,030
And a bit later, we will make our lives a bit easier with some additional techniques.

83
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,040
But for now, let's roll with this.

84
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,870
And there you have it.

85
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:56,470
There you have a list of all the pizzas based on our pizza data array.

86
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,150
Let's just get rid of this.

87
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,110
And of course, if we now remove something from here.

88
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,530
Then that last pizza over there is going to disappear.

89
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,700
You see.

90
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,160
But let's put it back.

91
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:14,180
And yeah, there it is.

92
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,620
Now notice how we have like an error here in the console.

93
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,630
So let's scroll up a little bit and see what we get.

94
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:27,740
So we have this warning saying that each child in a list should have a unique key property.

95
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:33,320
So basically what this means is that each time we render a list like this.

96
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,950
Where is it?

97
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,880
Yeah.

98
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,480
So each time we render a list with the map method, each of the items that gets rendered needs a unique

99
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,640
key property.

100
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:52,570
So key is basically a prop that is internal to react, which it needs in order for some performance

101
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,680
optimizations.

102
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,710
And for now it's not really important what that means as we will learn later what exactly this key property

103
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,380
is and what it does.

104
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:06,760
For now, what matters is that we pass something here that is unique to each element.

105
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,380
So to each pizza in this case, and that is the name.

106
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,090
So the name in this example is always unique.

107
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,280
So we can use that one as the unique key.

108
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,440
And so then the warning here is gone.

109
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,260
Okay.

110
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:28,140
Now, next, what I want to do is to convert this year from a simple div to a Ul.

111
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,090
So an unordered list.

112
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:38,960
And then each of these pizzas themselves should be a list element or a list item.

113
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,920
So an li.

114
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:46,340
So it's very important that we write semantic markup like this, which many courses somehow overlook,

115
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,380
but I believe it's quite important.

116
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:55,760
And here we are also missing an important class name to finally apply some more styling here.

117
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:58,600
Which is just pizzas.

118
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:05,110
And so this then puts the pizzas like nicely in this grid and makes this look even nicer.

119
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:07,420
So I'm really happy here with this design.

120
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:15,310
Like this and it's already starting to look like very familiar to what we have here.

121
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,630
Right.

122
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,420
We have just missing this button.

123
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:24,450
The text here is a bit different and we have some special styling here when a pizza is sold out.

124
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,790
And so we will actually talk about this here pretty soon.

125
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,920
But for now, let's quickly review what we did in this lecture.

126
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,700
And so that is fundamentally this part right here.

127
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:44,380
So the goal was to render one pizza element for each of the objects that are inside the pizza data array.

128
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,990
And the way we do that in React is by simply using the map method on this array.

129
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,870
And in case you're not entirely sure what the map method does, please go back to the previous section

130
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:01,090
where I will introduce you to all the most important array methods that we use all the time.

131
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,910
And this one here is probably the most important.

132
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,490
So it will create a new array.

133
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:12,110
And in this array in each position, there will be a new pizza component.

134
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:18,650
And into each of these pizza components we pass as a prop the current pizza object.

135
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:20,060
Right.

136
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,580
So we then receive that here as a prop, and from there we read all the data that we are interested

137
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:26,000
in.

138
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,680
All right.

139
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:33,270
Now, of course, we could also not even have this component.

140
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,640
Let me quickly show that to you as well.

141
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,030
So let's copy this.

142
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,660
And Well, then we can simply replace it here.

143
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,570
Paste that there.

144
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:48,690
And then, of course, we need to get rid.

145
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,920
Of all this.

146
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,940
So I'm just replacing all of them at the same time.

147
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,930
And please don't follow this code here, so you don't need to do this.

148
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:04,990
I just want to show you that we could have done it also without, like, the intermediary component.

149
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:13,210
So all that matters here is that we return some JSX X so we can directly write the JSX here.

150
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:18,250
But usually what we do is to place that JSX in another component.

151
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,490
So let's go back.

152
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,230
And there we go.

153
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,900
Now, you might have thought maybe that here we use a for each because it sounds a bit more logical.

154
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:37,330
Like maybe we want it to render one pizza for each of these, but that wouldn't really work.

155
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,090
Let's try that.

156
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,110
And you see that?

157
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,600
Then nothing happened.

158
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:51,080
And so that's because here inside this Ul, we actually need some JS and the only way we get that JS

159
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,050
is by creating a new array.

160
00:10:54,050 --> 00:10:55,970
And so that's what map does.

161
00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:01,640
So it creates a new array which will in this case contain these six pizzas.

162
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:08,360
And so then here we will have this array with all these pizzas and then react knows how to render that.

163
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:10,850
Okay.

164
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,940
So very, very important technique.

165
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,890
Make sure that you memorize this.

166
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:20,870
Or if you don't want to memorize, don't worry, because you will do this dozens of time throughout

167
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:21,650
the course.
