00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:06,320
So as I have mentioned a few times already, React is all about components.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:12,080
But now let's formally learn what React components are and why they are so important.

3
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:21,350
So components are the most fundamental concept in React simply because React applications are in fact

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,110
entirely made out of components.

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:32,210
So when you look at any React app, there's nothing that is not a component or at least not inside of

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,320
some component.

7
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:40,400
Therefore, I like to say that components are the building blocks of any user interface in React.

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:47,030
In fact, basically all React does is to take components and draw them onto a web page.

9
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,650
So on to a user interface or UI for short.

10
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:58,690
Now that sounds simple, but it's actually the main job of React in more technical terms.

11
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:06,090
React renders a view for each component and all these views together make up the user interface.

12
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:11,490
So we can also think of a component as being a piece of the user interface.

13
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:19,650
Right now, one key property of components is that each component has its own data, JavaScript, logic

14
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,120
and appearance.

15
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,990
So basically each component describes how it works and what it looks like, which makes them such a

16
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,830
great way of building user interfaces.

17
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:37,410
And speaking of building user interfaces, based on what we have just learned, it makes sense that

18
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:44,850
in React we build complex UIs like this one by building multiple components and then combining these

19
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:47,220
components like Lego pieces.

20
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:55,230
So here we can identify components like a video player, a menu, this questions list, and also this

21
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,440
part where we can refine the displayed questions.

22
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:05,520
So those are like the big components, but we can identify many other smaller components in this UI

23
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:09,570
as well, like for example, these filters right here.

24
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:16,530
And what you can see is that this filter is inside the refine questions component, right?

25
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:24,450
So actually, one thing that we do all the time is to place components inside of other components or

26
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,320
in other words, we nest components inside each other.

27
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,190
So nesting components is a key aspect of using components in React.

28
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,920
Along with component reusability.

29
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:41,840
Now notice how we have three similar questions in the questions list.

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,750
And so we can create one question component and then reuse it three times here.

31
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:54,350
Now, of course, the data for each of them is different, but we can easily pass different data into

32
00:02:54,350 --> 00:03:00,140
different question components by using something called props, which we're going to talk about later.

33
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:08,000
So whenever we need some duplication in our UI, we create a new component and reuse it as many times

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,050
as necessary.

35
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:15,890
So as you can see, one crucial skill that you will learn throughout this course is how to break a design

36
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:18,530
like this into its components.

37
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,550
Now, one thing that helps with that and with analyzing the components that we create is a component

38
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:27,320
tree like this one.

39
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:35,010
So this shows the hierarchy that exists between the components that make up the user interface, and

40
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:42,090
it makes it really easy to understand how all of these components are nested inside each other and really

41
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,430
how they relate to one another.

42
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:51,300
We can also clearly see relationships between components like the refine questions being the parent

43
00:03:51,300 --> 00:04:00,120
component of filters or the other way around that filters is a child component of refine questions and

44
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,640
we use these terms so parent and child component all the time in React.

45
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,760
And so it's important to understand what they mean.

46
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:15,750
And so a component tree like this is perfect to understand these kinds of relationships between components.

47
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,980
And I think that this is all you need to know about components.

48
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:26,580
For now, we will go really deep into some important concepts like reusability later.

49
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:31,110
But for now, let's start to put some of these concepts into practice.
