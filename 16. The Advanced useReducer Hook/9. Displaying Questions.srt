1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,590
So let's now render and display the current question.

2
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:13,550
So of course we will not render all the questions at the same time here, but instead one by one.

3
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:18,750
And so therefore we need a way of knowing which the current question is.

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:25,250
So basically we need some way of keeping track, which question is the current one?

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,310
And so let's add a new piece of state to our initial state here.

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:38,750
And we could call this the current or the current index, but I would like to just call it index.

7
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:40,330
No.

8
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:40,780
Okay.

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:48,700
At this index starts at zero because we will use this index here to take a certain question object out

10
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,230
of the questions array.

11
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:55,590
And so the first element of this questions array is element number zero.

12
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,570
Therefore, our index starts at zero.

13
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:04,660
And so then in the future, at some point, if we want to display the next question, we can already

14
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,860
imagine that we will do that by changing this index.

15
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:16,120
So then in the future, when we change that index from 0 to 1, that should display the next question.

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:22,240
So it should then rerender the screen and therefore this needs to be a state variable.

17
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:23,610
All right.

18
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:31,050
So that's the reasoning behind why we need this variable right here or this piece of state and also

19
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,170
why it needs to be state in the first place.

20
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:39,570
And again, it's because it needs to rerender the screen once it is updated.

21
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:48,930
But anyway, let's now take this index to pass in the right question object into our question component.

22
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:55,830
So this component will, of course, need access to that current question.

23
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,140
And as we just said, that will be questions.

24
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:05,010
So the array at the current position, which is index.

25
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,210
Okay.

26
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,540
Now here, that is not available because we haven't yet Destructured.

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,330
This index out of the state.

28
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,260
But there we go.

29
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,530
And now let's go to this component.

30
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:26,730
And just like before, if I hit the command key and then click here, it will automatically go to that

31
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,340
component even if it is in another file.

32
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,570
All right.

33
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:36,160
So here, let's now receive that question.

34
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:42,050
And then let's display it.

35
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,440
Well, first, let's even take a look at the shape of this object so that we actually know what we are

36
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,340
dealing with.

37
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,590
So let's come to the console and as we click here, that should appear.

38
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,730
So inside the question we have the question property.

39
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,510
So that's what we want to use first.

40
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,640
So here we have basically question dot, question.

41
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,350
And so with this, we get the question already here in the UI.

42
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,720
Great.

43
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,990
But then we also have this array of the options.

44
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:28,830
And so next we will want to loop over this array and of course display these options as well.

45
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:36,750
Now this time I will not use a unordered list for that because we will not have list elements but actual

46
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,500
buttons.

47
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,530
So here, let's.

48
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,540
Call this the options.

49
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,840
And so then here we loop over question.

50
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,920
Dot options.

51
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,450
And then dot map.

52
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:00,470
So here each of them is a question or actually it is an option.

53
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:10,070
And so then for each of them, what I want to do is to return a button with the class name of BTN and

54
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,420
BTN.

55
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,050
Upton.

56
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:14,920
No.

57
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,340
Okay.

58
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:22,480
And then as for the text, it should simply be the option itself, because as we see, this is just

59
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,650
a simple string.

60
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,890
So each of the options is just the string.

61
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,220
And so that's already looking great.

62
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,780
Let's just see what we have here.

63
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,500
Ah, of course we are missing the key property.

64
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:42,450
So very important for optimization, as we have already learned at this point.

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,400
So the options are unique and therefore we can use each of them as a key.

66
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,910
So as we reload, then let's start.

67
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:56,380
And there is our first question together with the options.

68
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,850
Nice.

69
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,710
Now here.

70
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,580
Actually, I would like to split this component into.

71
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:11,500
So whenever there is a list like this, I personally prefer to have a smaller component in a situation

72
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,490
like this.

73
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:20,170
So based on the logical separation of the content of this component, I would say that we can now split

74
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,430
this component.

75
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:27,280
So let's grab this entire part and let's create a new component.

76
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:35,050
And actually we are creating so many components that it is a common practice to create a new folder

77
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,570
called components.

78
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,860
And so this is where we then create a components.

79
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:48,440
So let's do this one right here and then I will later put all the other ones there as well.

80
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,690
So options dot JS.

81
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,000
And then our snippet again.

82
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,000
And here we already have the X.

83
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,040
So let's place that there.

84
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,740
Now here, this is missing the question.

85
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,350
But let's first of all place all the other components into this components folder.

86
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,710
So that's app the date counter error header.

87
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,030
Loader main question and start screen.

88
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,270
So we already have a lot of components here.

89
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,500
And so let's place them all in there.

90
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:32,940
Now, of course we will have a problem in the Index.js file because it is still trying to read the app

91
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,700
component from the same folder as before.

92
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,620
But so now it's in the components folder.

93
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,690
So we need to change that here.

94
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:47,650
But then all the other will still work because we are importing them here inside App.js.

95
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,920
And so here we are importing them from the same folder.

96
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,500
And so that's why this still works.

97
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:55,060
No.

98
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:55,810
Right.

99
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:02,030
But anyway, coming back here to our options here, we now need to receive the question.

100
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,300
And so then, of course, we need to.

101
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,310
Pass it in there.

102
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,920
So we need to even import that here.

103
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,220
So options.

104
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:22,390
And then with the current question and then just importing that here.

105
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:27,060
So import options from.

106
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,550
And again, it's the same folder.

107
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,200
And let's test.

108
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,640
And there we go.

109
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:39,210
Now, of course, when we click here now, nothing happens.

110
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:42,900
And so that's what we will take care of in the next video.
