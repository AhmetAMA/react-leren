1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:07,520
So let's continue building our application and display the progress that the user has been making in

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,330
the quiz.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:13,870
So basically what we want to show is this right here.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:20,670
So the current question out of the number of question and the current points out of the number of points

5
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,100
and then also this nice progress bar.

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:31,220
So basically what we want to do is to, besides the question at the next button, also display a progress

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,240
component.

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,290
And let's actually first go build that component.

9
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:38,860
So a new file.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,590
Just calling it progress.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,420
And then scaffold our new component like this.

12
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,440
And then let's get to work.

13
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:55,050
Now here, let's actually use a more semantic header element.

14
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,840
So a header inside the main part.

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,890
So that's perfectly semantic and so.

16
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,670
I think it's a good element to use here.

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,670
And let's give it the class name of progress.

18
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,230
Okay.

19
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:16,870
And let's start with one paragraph for each of these sites right there.

20
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,310
So here we need the current question.

21
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:24,980
So remember, that is the index.

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,360
And then let's place it inside the strong tag.

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,890
Just write it again.

24
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:37,340
That's easier then to copy and paste that.

25
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,480
And then here we also need the number of questions.

26
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,790
So these things we will need to receive.

27
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,630
As props.

28
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,260
And this, of course, is called index, not just I.

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,920
So index and num questions.

30
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,300
I believe it is called.

31
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,130
And so let's already try this out.

32
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,110
So progress.

33
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:11,350
And I'm selecting this one here from the list again, because here this shows me that this will then

34
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:16,840
automatically import the component into this page.

35
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,100
So into this file.

36
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,550
So we need again, the index and we need the number of questions.

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,460
Okay.

38
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,880
So let's see.

39
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:34,030
And yeah, we already have something.

40
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,110
Let's just start from scratch.

41
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,130
And so now we see that we have question zero here.

42
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:46,370
And so that's of course, because the index is zero based, but our users don't know that.

43
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,540
So it looks a lot nicer if we just start at one, right?

44
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,000
The next step.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,770
We want the current points.

46
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,600
And again, let's make them bold.

47
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,520
So that's points.

48
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,790
And then out of all the possible points.

49
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:12,190
So that will basically be the sum of all the points of all the questions.

50
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,280
However, we don't have that value yet.

51
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,260
And so.

52
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,950
Well, let's go compute it.

53
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,780
Let's just write an X here.

54
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,140
Take the points so that we can correctly display our component.

55
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,260
So points.

56
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:32,980
All right.

57
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:39,110
Apparently we haven't destructured that yet, but it should be in our state because I remember how we

58
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,120
updated it earlier.

59
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,310
And yeah, now it is zero.

60
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,190
Okay.

61
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,050
And now let's get the maximum amount of points that the user can make.

62
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:57,600
And so that again is derived state because we can just compute that from the questions array.

63
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,040
So let's say Max.

64
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,430
Possible points.

65
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:12,500
So that's questions dot reduce because we want to reduce this into just one single value.

66
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:18,740
And so here the callback always gets the previous value and the current value in the array.

67
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,200
So that's the first argument.

68
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,490
And then the second argument is the initial value.

69
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,640
And so now all we need to do is to add the previous value.

70
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:34,800
So the one that starts at zero with the current question.

71
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,140
Not points.

72
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:40,850
So just a normal regular reducer right here.

73
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,060
So that should be nothing strange for you at this point.

74
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,940
And so let's then pass that in.

75
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,020
And copy that.

76
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:58,950
And then replace our X right here.

77
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:01,030
So let's see.

78
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,220
And beautiful.

79
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,460
The only thing that we are missing is.

80
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,180
Well here we now need to restart because this one times out after a few minutes.

81
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:19,320
So we also want this progress bar here that keeps going as soon as we complete more questions.

82
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:26,800
So you see that it keeps going and this element is actually a progress bar.

83
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,970
So this one is a new one, or at least one that I haven't really used before.

84
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,620
And so here we can define the max value that this can take.

85
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,860
And here it makes sense that this is the number of questions.

86
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:45,840
So it will go basically from 0 to 15 in this case.

87
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,960
And then we can also define the current value.

88
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:52,590
So this is basically like an input element.

89
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:58,620
And so here we are making it a controlled element in a way, even though we cannot really set the state

90
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:00,150
on the progress bar.

91
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,570
But anyway, here at the current value will be the current index.

92
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:12,420
And here it's actually the index, not the index plus one because we actually want this to start empty.

93
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,540
So when we come here, we want it to be empty at the beginning.

94
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,520
And so let's see.

95
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,540
Let's click here.

96
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,000
And now you see that it didn't really move.

97
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,970
It will only move once we click here.

98
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,860
So then it moved here to one.

99
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,140
So if we inspect this element, we will see that the max is 15.

100
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:36,710
Of course.

101
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,060
And the value is one.

102
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:45,140
So we can change that here just to see, for example, this is what it would look like with ten and

103
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,570
then with 15, it would be completely full.

104
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:55,160
But anyway, the behavior here is slightly different because here when we click, then it immediately

105
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,900
moves to the next one.

106
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:04,070
So right after we click so somehow basically this detects if there is an answer and if so, it then

107
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,680
immediately moves this value forward.

108
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:12,640
So let's implement that here so we can just pass in the answer.

109
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:16,840
And then I will show you a very nice trick that we can use.

110
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:19,960
So we can.

111
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,690
Convert to a number.

112
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,500
The boolean that will result from checking again if there is an answer or not.

113
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,850
So doing this.

114
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,850
So basically what this does is that if there is no answer, then this is false.

115
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,780
And so then number will convert that false to a zero.

116
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:47,580
But if there is an answer, then this will of course be true and then that true will be converted to

117
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,030
one.

118
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,630
And so then we add one to the index.

119
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,790
So let's see.

120
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,740
And.

121
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,070
Well, that's already at one here.

122
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,160
But that's because I didn't pass in the answer.

123
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,110
So right now the answer is then undefined and undefined is different from null.

124
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,340
And so that then gives already one.

125
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,710
So of course we also need to pass the answer as a prop.

126
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,320
But this will then fix it.

127
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:26,090
So as you see, it's just completely normal that these unexpected small mistakes happen.

128
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,890
But in any case, now that's fixed.

129
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,040
And so this is what we were looking for.

130
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:38,590
So it keeps going forward all the way until the end, which I will not do now as that takes just a bit

131
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,490
too much time.

132
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:45,940
But anyway, with this, we successfully finished the task that we had for this lecture.

133
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,740
So let's close this one.

134
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,670
We don't need anymore, nor this one or this one.

135
00:08:51,670 --> 00:08:54,640
And so with this, let's now move forward.
