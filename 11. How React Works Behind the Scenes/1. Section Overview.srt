1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:08,750
Welcome to probably the most challenging section in this course, but also one of the most exciting

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:11,660
ones and most rewarding ones.

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:20,390
So up until this point, we have only focused on how React concepts and features work in practice.

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:28,550
But now it's time to understand how things actually work internally, inside, react behind the scenes.

5
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:38,210
So just like my other courses, this course also includes a really deep dive, which most students absolutely

6
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:45,950
love, because this information you're about to learn will not only make you a much better and more

7
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:54,080
confident react developer, but it will also allow you to ace the most common React interview questions

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:01:03,270
with all the confidence that you need in order to nail that job and would go as far as saying that this

9
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:10,440
knowledge will actually put you right in the top 5% of all react developers.

10
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:19,530
Now, again, this section is quite intense and it should probably be in the advanced part of the course.

11
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:26,310
But since there is so much important stuff that we need to talk about before moving on, I decided to

12
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,990
place it right here.

13
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:35,700
If at some point it becomes a bit too much or if you become bored, please watch at least the final

14
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,270
lecture of the section where I'm briefly going to summarize everything we covered.

15
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,880
So that video really is a must watch.

16
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:53,430
But anyway, without further ado, let's dive right in and uncover how React works.
