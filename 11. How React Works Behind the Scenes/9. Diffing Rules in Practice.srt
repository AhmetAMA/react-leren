1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,220
In this lecture.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:09,000
I just want to quickly demonstrate the different rules that we just learned in our project so that you

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,310
can see that they actually do have a practical effect in the real world.

4
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:21,680
So let's start by examining a bit better what happens as we use this tab component?

5
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:29,180
So again, here we have this button that when we click, we'll hide that paragraph, right?

6
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,850
And also when we click here, then we update the state and the likes number increases.

7
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,990
So that's what happens in this tab.

8
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,000
But now watch what happens when we go to another tab.

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:49,930
So you see that the text is still hidden and the number of likes is still at four.

10
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:56,970
So what this means is that the state of this tab component instance has been preserved.

11
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:03,090
Now, if we hadn't learned about this in the previous section, then this would look really strange,

12
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:03,860
right?

13
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,170
Because we would expect that whenever we go to a new tab that the state would be reset.

14
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:12,610
But that's not what happens.

15
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:18,070
So as we click around here, the only thing that happens is that this title here is changed.

16
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:22,920
I mean, this text down here also changes, but it stays invisible.

17
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,430
So here the text changed and the state again stayed the same at the same here for the number of likes.

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,570
So what is actually happening?

19
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:42,210
Well, basically, each time that we click on one of these tabs, the tab component down here is rerendered.

20
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,870
However, as we can see down here in this component tree, as we keep clicking around, we see that

21
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:54,830
the tab content component instance always stays in the exact same position in the tree.

22
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,510
And so with this, we are now in the situation that we learned in the previous lecture where we have

23
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,870
the same element.

24
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,270
So in this case the same component in the same position.

25
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,370
And so because of that, the state is preserved across renders.

26
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,680
So just like we learned before.

27
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:21,320
So again, as we keep clicking around these tabs here, this component instance here is actually not

28
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,120
destroyed.

29
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:28,040
So it stays in the Dom and the only thing that changes is the props that it receives.

30
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,580
So of course the props will change.

31
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:33,260
So where is that?

32
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,190
Uh, right here.

33
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,710
So you see that now as I click here.

34
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,650
Then, of course, down here the prop will have changed, but that's the only thing that changes.

35
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,090
So the state again, remains completely unchanged.

36
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:52,140
But what if we now click on this tab, number four?

37
00:02:52,350 --> 00:03:00,840
So as you can see in our code in this case, so when the Tab num is three, actually this different

38
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,730
content component will be rendered right?

39
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,410
And so let's see what's going to happen.

40
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,720
So we have number four here and we have the text closed.

41
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:21,150
So now we click here and immediately we see that we get a completely different component instance right

42
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:21,750
here.

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,610
So it's still in the same position of the tree, but it's no longer tab content but different content.

44
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:32,310
And so now when I go back, watch what happens.

45
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,800
So now the state has actually been reset.

46
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:43,040
And so that's because the Tab content that we had here before has been completely destroyed and removed

47
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,050
from the Dom in the meantime.

48
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:52,370
So while we were at the different content and so that's why I placed this string here which says that

49
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,640
this is a different tab and so it resets state.

50
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,380
And so indeed if we keep going here, maybe we hide this.

51
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:08,750
Then again, when we go here and we go back, then the state has been reset because again, in the meantime,

52
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,760
this component here has disappeared and with it its state.

53
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:19,500
So this is a direct consequence of the diffing rules that we just learned about.

54
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:25,530
And so this means that these rules are very important actually in practice.

55
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,970
So you can see this situation happening all the time.

56
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:35,170
And actually we saw the exact same thing in or eat and split application.

57
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:40,970
But don't worry about that for now because we will come back to that app actually in a few lectures

58
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:41,720
from now.

59
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,220
Now, sometimes, of course, we do not want this behavior.

60
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:50,150
So actually, just as I was saying in the last lecture as well.

61
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:57,140
So, for example, let's say I hide the details here, but then I actually expect that when I go to

62
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,350
a new tab that it starts again with the default.

63
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:02,690
So with this opened again.

64
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,170
So again, usually this is not what we want.

65
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:10,370
And so let's take a look at how we can solve this in the next video.
