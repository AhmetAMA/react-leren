1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:08,980
So as promised, let's now shortly look at component instances and react elements in our code.

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:16,930
So what I want to do in this lecture is just a couple of quick experiments to show you some interesting

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:17,680
things.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,420
So first off, we can actually look at a component instance simply by using the component and logging

5
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,890
it to the console.

6
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,170
So let's try that out.

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,170
So actually, right out here, we can write like this.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,980
So let's use the different component or the different content component because this one doesn't have

9
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:43,970
any state.

10
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,160
All right.

11
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,020
And if we run this, then we should see something in the console.

12
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,280
And indeed, there it is.

13
00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:01,640
So as soon as React sees this right here, it will internally call the different content function and

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,430
will then return this react element.

15
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,400
So just like we learned in the previous video.

16
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,460
So let's take a quick look at this.

17
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:17,600
And while this is not really interesting, we can see that the type here is of different content.

18
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,260
And so that's exactly the name of the component right here.

19
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,420
We can also see that we didn't pass in any props, but which we actually could.

20
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,010
So let's just do test equals 23.

21
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,580
And so then we should see that right here.

22
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,350
So now in the second one and indeed there it is.

23
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:44,990
So again, this is what react internally use to then later create our Dom elements.

24
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:51,890
Now if you're wondering what this weird dollar, dollar type of thing here is, well, this is simply

25
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:59,690
a security feature that React has implemented in order to protect us against cross-site scripting attacks.

26
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:08,130
So notice how this is a symbol and the symbols are one of the JavaScript primitives which cannot be

27
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:16,440
transmitted via Json or in other words, this means that a symbol like this cannot come from an API

28
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,010
call.

29
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:25,590
So if some hacker would try to send us a fake react element from that API, then React would not see

30
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:31,860
this type of as a symbol again, because symbols cannot be transmitted via Json.

31
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,290
And so then React would not include that fake react element into the Dom.

32
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,280
So protecting us against that kind of attack.

33
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,600
All right.

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,130
But anyway, let's come back here and try something else.

35
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,470
So if React calls our component internally when it renders them.

36
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:59,820
So just as it did here in this previous line, then maybe you have wondered, why don't we just call

37
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,630
components directly?

38
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:06,310
So why should we write it like this when we could also write?

39
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,270
Different content.

40
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,350
Like this.

41
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:18,710
So basically calling the function ourselves, well, there is really nothing stopping us from doing

42
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,290
so.

43
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,570
So if we save this, then we actually get a result as well.

44
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:27,910
Let's just reload here so that we only get these two outputs.

45
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,340
So one output from here and one from here.

46
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:38,260
So you see that even here in this case, we still got a react element like this.

47
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,110
However, it is a very different one.

48
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:49,090
So this one no longer has the type of different content and instead it is a div, which is basically

49
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:52,300
just the content of that component.

50
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:56,680
So this div here is now the type of this react element.

51
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,350
And we can also see that because the props include the class name of tab content.

52
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:10,750
So what this means is that right now React does no longer see this as a component instance, and instead

53
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,940
it just sees the raw react element, which is really not what we want.

54
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:24,200
So when we write or actually when we use a component we want react to see the component instance and

55
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,040
not the raw output element like this one.

56
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,150
So never do this.

57
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:38,470
What we did right here and let's actually demonstrate this one more time, but now inside the component

58
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,010
here.

59
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:47,920
So after all this, let's enter JavaScript mode here and then let's just call.

60
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,790
Or actually tab content.

61
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:57,190
This time let's call tap content and we can pass in props just like this.

62
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:03,150
So we pass in an object and then item and then let's say content.

63
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,320
At zero.

64
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:12,490
And well, we got some errors here, but let's try to reload.

65
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:15,760
And now this somehow works.

66
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,850
So you see that?

67
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,320
Actually, we got a second tab content rendered down here.

68
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,190
So it looks like this works, right?

69
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,530
Well, not so fast.

70
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,790
Let's check out our component tree here again.

71
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,980
We need some more space.

72
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,850
And so now you see that we still only have one tab content here in our component tree.

73
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:49,030
And so this happened exactly because of what I explained before, which is that when we call a component

74
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:54,610
directly like this, then react no longer sees it as a component instance.

75
00:05:54,790 --> 00:06:03,340
Now, we can also see that the state that this component manages is actually now inside the parent state

76
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,900
or the parent component.

77
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:13,390
So if we check out the tabbed component here, you see that it has the normal state that it had before,

78
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:20,600
which is this active tab, but it also has some other hooks here which come from tab content.

79
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:27,310
So these two are the two hooks that are inside this component, but they don't really belong here.

80
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:32,950
So we actually want them to be inside tab content and not inside.

81
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,860
Well, not here inside the tabbed component.

82
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:43,520
So what this means again, is that this is here not really a component because it cannot even manage

83
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,920
its own state at this point.

84
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,980
So for all these reasons, you should never, ever do what we just did here because this will create

85
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:58,960
multiple problems, such as violating the rules of hooks that we will talk about later.

86
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,780
So instead, as you already know, always render it inside the JS.

87
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,820
So just like this and so here we just use the component.

88
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:16,110
So basically this blueprint like we have always been doing and so then React calls the component and

89
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,770
actually recognizes this as a component instance.

90
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,560
All right.

91
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,300
So let's reload here again and then we are back to normal.

92
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,050
All right.

93
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:37,860
And here we can see one of those examples that we talked about in the previous lecture.

94
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,890
So we wrote one tab component here.

95
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,690
So this is like the blueprint.

96
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:50,860
But then we have four component instances, each with its own state and its own props.
