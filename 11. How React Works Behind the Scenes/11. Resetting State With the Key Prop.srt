1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:08,570
So let's now use what we just learned about the key prop to our advantage and fix our tabbed component.

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:16,980
So as we have just explored previously, as we change the state here in this tab component.

3
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:22,980
That state will be preserved as we rerender that component.

4
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:29,820
And so, again, that's because this component is exactly of the same type as before.

5
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:37,390
So it stays the same element between renders and it also stays in the exact same place in the component

6
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:37,900
tree.

7
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:46,270
And so therefore it's state is not reset, it is only reset when we change to a different component

8
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,190
type here.

9
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,250
So now that's different content and then change back.

10
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,120
So now in the meantime, our state was lost.

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,090
But if we do this and then change here, then the state is preserved across renders.

12
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:06,250
Now, as we were saying also before, this is usually not what we want.

13
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:10,180
And so let's now use the key prop to change this.

14
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,330
And actually it is extremely easy.

15
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:21,650
All we have to do is to give this tab content here a different key for each of the tabs basically.

16
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:29,000
So then each time that this tab content component here is re rendered, it will get a different key.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,170
And so then React will see it as a unique component instance and therefore then the old one will be

18
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:39,110
destroyed and the state will be reset.

19
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:42,890
So just as we just learned in the previous lecture.

20
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:44,690
And so let's do that.

21
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,960
So let's give it a key that will change between renders.

22
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,470
So something unique here.

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,150
So let's take.

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,720
The content object again at the current position.

25
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,380
And then let's, for example, take the summary.

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,260
All right.

27
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,580
So here we do not have like a unique ID, but we can see that the summary is always different.

28
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:23,910
And so as soon as the tab content component will be rerendered, then not only this item here will change,

29
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,280
but also the key.

30
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:32,940
And so we are then in that situation where the key changes across renders and again that will then reset

31
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,050
our state.

32
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,090
So let's hide this here.

33
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:43,520
Let's improve or likes and then let's go to another tab and beautiful.

34
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,480
So you see that our component state has indeed been reset.

35
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:56,400
And again, that's just because React now views this as a completely different instance of tab content.

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,540
And we can see that here because now our devtools display this key and when we move here, then we get

37
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:04,410
another one.

38
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:12,640
And so yeah, this is exactly how React now makes each of these tab contents here unique and distinguishes

39
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,450
between them.

40
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,510
Yeah.

41
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,450
So this is really nice, really helpful.

42
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:26,150
And so you really need to understand what just happened here and then keep it in mind for future situations.

43
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:33,630
So actually, still remember personally when I first learned about the power of the key prop here.

44
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,470
So this was actually a key learning moment for me.

45
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,500
So it was really eye opening.

46
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,670
And so I hope I could provide the same experience here for you.

47
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:50,550
So this key prop here, it looks very simple, but it can make a huge difference.

48
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:57,180
And so let's now actually also use this key prop in the heat and Split app that we built before.

49
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,820
So let's do that in the next video.
