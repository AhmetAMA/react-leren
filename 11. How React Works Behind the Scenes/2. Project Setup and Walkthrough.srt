1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:07,760
Now, before we go, learn about how React works behind the scenes, let's quickly set up and walk through

2
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:13,070
a small demo project that we're going to need in a few lectures of this section.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:21,460
Now, this time around, we will do things a bit differently so we will not create a new project using

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,360
Create React app instead in the starter files.

5
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,100
I already basically have that entire project for you to copy.

6
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:36,850
So open up the starter files and then here in this folder called How React Works.

7
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,700
Let's copy this entire starter folder.

8
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,030
So copy all of this right into the folder where we are building our projects.

9
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:50,150
And so then simply call it how.

10
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,620
React works.

11
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,560
So you see that here?

12
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:02,370
We actually have the source folder, we have the public folder and also these other files that are always

13
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,760
automatically created by Create React app.

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,300
But again, this time we are not doing that because, well, everything has been done already for us.

15
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:19,470
And so now all we have to do is to take this folder, open it up in vs code.

16
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,610
Like this.

17
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,830
And then we need to install all the packages.

18
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,390
So the node modules folder, which is the folder where all the NPM packages are installed, is of course

19
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,230
not here.

20
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,880
So all the libraries like react, react, Dom and so on.

21
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,060
They are not here, so we need to install them.

22
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,850
But that's fortunately very easy.

23
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,790
So let's open up our terminal here.

24
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,660
Uh, it's here in view.

25
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,500
And that's really small here.

26
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,250
And as always, make sure that you are in the correct folder.

27
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:06,150
And then all we have to do is to say npm install or npm I for short.

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,910
So hit enter.

29
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:14,330
And then this will install all the packages that are necessary for this create React application.

30
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,460
So it will get this information here from this package dot Json file.

31
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,840
Okay.

32
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,300
And we see that it's already done.

33
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,810
And so we can now start this project.

34
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:30,600
So just write npm start.

35
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:36,430
And then in my case here, it's asking me if I want to run the app on another port.

36
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:41,710
And so that's because I already had something running here on 3000.

37
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,780
So that's basically the demo project.

38
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,270
But let's close that for now, actually.

39
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,360
So just inspecting this and then let's open up our App.js file as always.

40
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:04,670
So this time around, in this section I gave you this already started project so that you can now get

41
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:11,000
the experience of looking at a project where someone already started writing some code.

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,520
So that's exactly what we have here.

43
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,260
So some code here has already been written.

44
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:22,680
And so you can now pretend that basically some other developer on your team wrote this.

45
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:29,290
So it's extremely important that you be able to understand other developers code, especially when you

46
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:33,580
work on a team as a professional react developer someday.

47
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:40,630
And so before we now start this section, I just want us to quickly walk through this code here so I

48
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,330
can explain you how it works on a high level.

49
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:50,290
And then by doing so, you can see how we can effectively read code that we didn't write ourselves.

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,090
So let's start in the app component here.

51
00:03:54,090 --> 00:04:01,560
And all that one does is to include the tabbed component and it parses the content in there, which

52
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,140
is simply this array of objects here.

53
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,610
So pretty standard.

54
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:12,610
Then the tabbed component has some state variable here which indicates the current tab.

55
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,650
So it seems like this is a number.

56
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:23,990
And then down here we can see that the active Tab State is used to render this tab content component

57
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:31,070
using as the content, the content array at the position of the currently active tab.

58
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:38,210
So this add here is basically modern JavaScript, which is the same as this here.

59
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:45,170
So basically reading something out of an array and that array again is this content array up here.

60
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:54,450
So, for example, if the state here was two, then the content here in the tab would be 012.

61
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,800
So it would be this object right here.

62
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,710
All right, let's just put this back here to this more modern form.

63
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,310
And then let's check out what this tab content here actually is.

64
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:13,140
And it's also always a good idea to take a look at the component tree.

65
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,840
And so let's make this year bigger.

66
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,190
And so indeed, we have the app.

67
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:23,010
We have tabbed and then we have the tab content in there.

68
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,120
And of course we also have these four tabs, but we will leave them for a bit later.

69
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:32,840
So in here in the tab content, let's see what we have.

70
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:37,660
So we get the tab item, which is basically the content that we're going to use here.

71
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,670
So we can double click on that and then we see where it has been used.

72
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,410
So we see that we use item dot summary and item dot details.

73
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,080
Then we also see that we have two state variables here.

74
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:57,810
So that's show details and set show details and again by double clicking vs code will then highlight

75
00:05:57,810 --> 00:05:58,680
all of them.

76
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,720
So here we can see that we're doing some conditional rendering with this show details.

77
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,870
And so, yeah, by default, this is true.

78
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:14,820
And then only in that case we are displaying the item details and then we change that state down here

79
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,570
where we have set show details in this button.

80
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,150
And so this here is exactly that button.

81
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:25,140
So if we click that, then here the text disappears.

82
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:28,200
So this paragraph right here disappears.

83
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,080
Right.

84
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:36,020
Then we also have these two buttons down here, but we see that they have no event handler attached.

85
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,020
So if we click here, then nothing happens.

86
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:47,370
Then finally, we also have those hearts here, and that's why we have this second state of likes.

87
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:50,790
So you see that likes is indeed used here.

88
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,680
And then this button here has the handle Inc function.

89
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,920
So this first one here, while the second button again has no handler.

90
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,510
So here nothing happens.

91
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,610
But here each time we click basically one like is added there.

92
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,570
And so that's because of the handle Inc function.

93
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:17,240
So what this one does is simply take the current likes and adding one and then setting that as the new

94
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,560
likes state.

95
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:25,580
Now notice how here we didn't use a callback function in order to set state based on the current state,

96
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,640
but more about that later.

97
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,090
So I think this component here is pretty clear.

98
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:37,010
And so let's now go back here and see what these tabs here actually are.

99
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:45,060
So here we have these four tabs and notice how we are actually writing them one by one manually and

100
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,130
not looping over some array.

101
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,270
So our array has these three elements here.

102
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,520
And so the first three elements.

103
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,340
So these three are for those three objects.

104
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:02,000
And then we have another one where the number is three.

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,430
But let's take a look at that a bit later.

106
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:11,870
So here we have the Num as a prop, we have the active tab and we have the onClick prop.

107
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:17,810
And as the onClick, we are simply passing the set active tab, state setter function.

108
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:22,100
Now let's go here into the tab and see what happens there.

109
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,200
So basically a tab is just a button.

110
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,680
So it's these buttons right here.

111
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:34,930
And what happens when we click on this button is that the onClick function is called with the current

112
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,650
number.

113
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:42,510
So let's then actually go back to where these props are passed so that we can understand what the onClick

114
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,340
and enum actually are.

115
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:51,310
So onClick is set active tab and num are these numbers here?

116
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,950
And so basically when we click on this first tab, it means that the active tab will get set to zero

117
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,860
and the same down here.

118
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:06,440
So when we click on this tab right here, then the active tab will get set to one, which is exactly

119
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,650
what we have here.

120
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:14,780
Then based on this state, as I explained in the beginning, we see that the Tab content will be rendered

121
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:19,310
at least if that value is less or equal to.

122
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:26,840
So if it's greater than two, which happens in this case, then the different content will be displayed.

123
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,240
So let's check that out.

124
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:35,960
And so this one is simply this one div which has a simple h4.

125
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,270
Okay.

126
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:45,350
So again, basically the goal of this other tab right here is just to display this different content

127
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,640
component right here.

128
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,000
So let's see that in action.

129
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,800
And so indeed, when we click on Tab two, you see that the content here changed.

130
00:09:54,890 --> 00:10:01,050
And so the title here in the text are exactly what we have here in this second object.

131
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,600
And then the same here.

132
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,110
So here we now have the third object.

133
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,210
So the title and the text.

134
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,970
And finally the last one is for.

135
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,200
Well, for that different content.

136
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,810
And you saw that down here.

137
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,120
Actually, the component tree changed.

138
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,610
All right.

139
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:27,140
And here, if we wrote any other number like zero, then of course, you see that the number changed

140
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,790
here.

141
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,400
So that is always the number plus one.

142
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,790
And we get then the very first object.

143
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:38,480
So now it says React is a library for building UIs.

144
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:46,580
So just like here and also both of them are now marked active, which also happens inside that tab component.

145
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,450
But of course, let's put it back to two.

146
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:57,540
And with this, I think it is pretty clear what this very small demo application does.

147
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:03,280
But before you move on to the next lecture, make sure that you take some more time to analyze this

148
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,110
code on your own so that you truly understand what exactly is happening here.
