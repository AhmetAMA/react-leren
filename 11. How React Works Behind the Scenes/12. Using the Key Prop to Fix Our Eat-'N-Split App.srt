1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:09,630
So as I was just saying, let's now go back to our Eaton split up to fix one problem that we have left

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:11,010
in that application.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:19,950
So let's come to our desktop and then grab the project folder and open it in vs code.

4
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,040
Okay.

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:29,700
And so now we have to vs code windows open and we will also start to react apps at the same time.

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,940
So let's just write npm start.

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:38,250
Hit, enter and then it will ask you to use another port instead.

8
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:44,100
And so that's simply because you're already running one app here in this other port.

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,970
And of course each one can only have one app running.

10
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:56,440
So just hit enter or y as you reached this step and then you will see your application pop up right

11
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:56,950
here.

12
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:03,300
Let's get a bit more space and then let me show you the problem that we actually left here.

13
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:09,700
So let's say that we typed some values in here and then we moved to another friend.

14
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:15,220
So here we have exactly the same problem as before.

15
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:21,940
So as we select another friend, the only thing that changes is really the props that is being passed

16
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,530
here into this component.

17
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,000
So let's check out the name of that component.

18
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,490
So I don't remember it.

19
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,020
So yeah, it's this form split Bill.

20
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,000
So this one receives the selected friend object.

21
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:43,590
But as you see here, as we change, nothing changes in the Dom tree.

22
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:50,580
And so across these rerenders, exactly the same component is rendered in exactly the same position

23
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,560
of the tree.

24
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,370
So just like before.

25
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,690
And so therefore the state is not reset across renders.

26
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:05,850
But also just like before, this is not the behavior that we would expect in this application, right?

27
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:12,210
So if suddenly we move from one friend to the other one, we would certainly expect that the bill value

28
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:14,460
here should be reset.

29
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,180
So how can we do that?

30
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:22,730
Well, let's see where we are using this form split Bill.

31
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,590
So that should be somewhere here in the app, probably.

32
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,470
So, yeah, here it is.

33
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:40,340
And so now we basically need to make each component instance here unique so that each time that it is

34
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:46,380
rendered with a new friend, React will see this as a completely new component instance.

35
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,480
And as you already know, the way we do that is by providing a key that will actually change across

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,680
the rerenders.

37
00:02:55,010 --> 00:03:00,680
So here we can use the selected friend.id, I guess.

38
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,620
So let's just see if they actually have an ID.

39
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,940
And yeah, they have.

40
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,510
So we could also use the name here.

41
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,140
Really.

42
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:12,540
So those are also different.

43
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,630
But the idea is really a unique identifier.

44
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,360
So let's see.

45
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,940
So we are at Sarah.

46
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,130
And so therefore, let's see down here.

47
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,850
So here we see that the key now is nine three, three, whatever.

48
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,910
And so let's move to another friend.

49
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,980
And there we go.

50
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:40,980
So we fixed our problem because now the component instance has another key.

51
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,300
And so therefore, it is a completely unique instance right now.

52
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,470
Great.

53
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,950
And that's actually it.

54
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,790
So that's all we have to do here.

55
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,760
So let's close this one and let's also close this.

56
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:55,290
So we are finished.

57
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,350
We are back in our project that we were working on before.

58
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,110
And so, yeah, there's nothing left to do.

59
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,080
And so let's move on right to the next lecture.
