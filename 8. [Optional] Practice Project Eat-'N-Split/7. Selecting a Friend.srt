1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:07,280
Now, in order to make our form work, the first thing that we need to do is to add the ability of the

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,380
user selecting a friend.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:17,430
So whenever we click here on Select, it will then open up the form with the information about this

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,150
user.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,790
So here is the name of the user.

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,850
And yeah, well, that's really all that we need.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:30,900
And then here you also see that the selected friend is marked here with this orange background and the

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,890
button text changes to close.

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,700
And then if we click on another one, then the information of this friend is passed in here.

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:46,470
So basically what we want is that whenever we click select on one of the friends here in this list component,

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,810
we want that information to pass here into this form component.

12
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,060
So how do we do that?

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,330
Well, basically, we want this component right here.

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:05,070
So this friend component, we want it to communicate with this form component, right?

15
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,870
So to basically pass it some data.

16
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:15,070
But as we can see here in our own component tree, those are actually sibling components.

17
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:25,790
And actually even worse than sibling components because the friends are inside the friend list and friend

18
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,660
list itself is then a sibling component of the form.

19
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,790
But in any case, since these two now need to share some state.

20
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:40,270
So basically they need to share this friend object that was selected here.

21
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,490
We need again, some lifted up state.

22
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:48,650
And so the first common parent is again, the app component.

23
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,810
And so let's in here create a new piece of state called Selected Friend.

24
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,520
And then set selected friend.

25
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:06,580
And here by default we will have null.

26
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:12,120
So basically no object at all, which means that no friend is selected.

27
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:19,300
And now let's start using this new piece of state here, because when there is no friend selected,

28
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:25,750
which is currently the case, since this is null, then we don't even want this form here to show up.

29
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,560
Right?

30
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,400
So let's go here into our JSX and.

31
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:39,430
Let's conditionally render this form so based off the state, let's say selected friend and then the

32
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,970
form.

33
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:47,260
So right now, selected friend is null and so the end operator will short circuit and will not display

34
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,980
anything.

35
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,080
And so then it's gone.

36
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:53,890
Great.

37
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,650
So we created the state.

38
00:02:55,660 --> 00:03:00,460
We used it already a little bit and now we need a way of updating it.

39
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:05,080
And so that of course, is going to happen whenever this button here is clicked.

40
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:13,390
So let's actually create a handler function again right here in the component that actually owns that

41
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,050
state.

42
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,760
So a function that we will then pass down via props as we have been doing also with the other functions.

43
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,620
So let's call this one handle.

44
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,320
The selection.

45
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:32,400
And so this one should receive a friend object.

46
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:43,060
So all this will do is to set the selected friend to the friend object that it will receive.

47
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,850
All right.

48
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:49,650
And so this is the function that will get called whenever we click on this button.

49
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:56,940
And so then whatever button is clicked, the Associated Friend object will be set as the currently selected

50
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,570
friend.

51
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,600
All right.

52
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
So let's pass that down.

53
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,070
And here this is getting a bit confusing.

54
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,280
Let's just add some spacing between all of these.

55
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,870
And so let's pass, let's say on selection.

56
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,750
Will be.

57
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:18,440
Handled with handle selection.

58
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:19,890
Okay.

59
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,180
And now in the friends list.

60
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,600
We need to receive that.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,620
So on selection, but it is actually not even this component that needs this, but the friend itself.

62
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:40,920
So here we can just pass it through this component by saying on selection as a new prop here should

63
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:43,650
then be passed here into the friend.

64
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,290
All right.

65
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:50,250
And so now this is where we will use this function.

66
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,400
So let's right here on this button.

67
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,890
So on click.

68
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,080
And then let's specify our function here because we want to call now.

69
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,550
Well, not this.

70
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,110
So we want to call on selection.

71
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,970
And pass in the current friend.

72
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,020
And that's it.

73
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,380
So whatever button here is now going to be clicked.

74
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:24,450
It will take the current friend and it will save it into the selected friend state.

75
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,890
So that's the same logic as before with some lifted up state.

76
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:37,550
Then we create a handler function which updates that state, and then we pass that handler function

77
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,110
down via props.

78
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:46,280
And so now when we click here, that should actually immediately open up the form and indeed it does.

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,840
All right.

80
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:52,100
Now there's still some things missing, but this is already great.

81
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,880
Now what we need to do next is to then actually pass that selected friend object here into the form

82
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,240
so that then here we can display the correct name.

83
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,160
So that doesn't sound too difficult.

84
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,820
And so it's right here.

85
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:14,940
So selected friend should be equal to selected friend.

86
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:18,700
Then let's come down here.

87
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,850
Let's receive that selected friend and then we can use that here.

88
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,330
So selected friend dot name.

89
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,390
And immediately you see Sarah there.

90
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,460
So that's great.

91
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,220
Let's just use it here in the other places.

92
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:46,840
So that's right here and right here.

93
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,690
Nice.

94
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,750
And if we click another one, watch what happens.

95
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,900
Yes, it changes to Anthony.

96
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,850
Or to Clark or whatever other friends that we have in our list.

97
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:03,360
Beautiful.

98
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,140
So that's working already.

99
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,130
Really nice.

100
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,600
Now the next step is to then basically mark this one here also as selected and change the button text

101
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,620
here to close.

102
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,650
So just as we have here.

103
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:22,750
So you see that here we have this nice background and yeah, the text has changed as well.

104
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,570
So how do we know inside of each friend if it is currently selected?

105
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,000
Well, first of all, we will have to pass in the currently selected friend.

106
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,450
And so then we can compare that with each friend.

107
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,220
So with the friend itself.

108
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,380
But that's easier to understand in code.

109
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:51,260
So as I said, let's come here into the app and let's pass the currently selected friend in as well.

110
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,650
So selected friend equals selected friend.

111
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,290
And now as we save prettier puts each of these props into its own line.

112
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,740
So this makes it a lot easier to see what's going on here.

113
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,220
But anyway, the friends list now receives the selected friend.

114
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,080
So.

115
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,110
Let's add that here.

116
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:22,770
And then once again, we don't need that directly here in the list, but we will need it inside the

117
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,340
friend.

118
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:25,770
So we just pass that through here.

119
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:32,000
Selected friend equals selected friend.

120
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,910
And by the way, whenever this happens, so whenever we have a component that doesn't actually need

121
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:43,610
the prop, but all it does with the prop is to pass it down into one of its children.

122
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,190
We say that we are prop drilling.

123
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,070
So in this case, that's not a big problem.

124
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:54,050
But sometimes we need to pass some prop through like 5 or 6 levels.

125
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,130
So then it becomes really problematic and we then need to solve that problem.

126
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:01,100
But here, that's no issue.

127
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,810
I just wanted to already prepare you for what's ahead, basically.

128
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,780
So at some point we will talk about that in detail.

129
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:16,610
But anyway, now here we can compare that selected friend with the current friend, basically.

130
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,090
So let's say is selected.

131
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:32,970
And so here we want a Boolean and so we can simply do selected friend.id equal to friend.id and that's

132
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,420
it.

133
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,820
So now we can use this to conditionally define a class name here.

134
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:47,800
And here let's now use JavaScript mode again so that we can say is selected.

135
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:53,650
Then add the class of selected and if not, then no class at all.

136
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,030
All right.

137
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:03,080
And you see, well, actually, you don't see this is the demo app, but you see it here.

138
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,380
So this already got now the nice background color.

139
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:11,170
And if we select this one, then it changes here to this other friend.

140
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:18,230
And so that's simply because this ID here of this friend is now exactly the same ID of the one that

141
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:19,310
we have selected.

142
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,780
And now all we need to do is to change that text there for closing.

143
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,890
And so that's down here.

144
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:37,390
So is selected, and if so, it should be close and otherwise select.

145
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,180
And yeah, there it is.

146
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:41,820
Great.

147
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,980
So that's working.

148
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:50,680
But what's not working is that when we click here again is that this is not closed.

149
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:57,700
And that makes sense because nowhere we are saying that when we click here again that the state should

150
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,990
be back to null.

151
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,190
And so that's what we need to do next.

152
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:08,250
So here where we handle the selection, basically when there is already a friend selected.

153
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,710
So which means that this here is open.

154
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,540
Then when we click here again, we want to change the selected friend back to null.

155
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,280
So back to the initial state, basically.

156
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:22,350
And so here now we need to do something else.

157
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,990
Let's just comment it out.

158
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:30,780
And so now this will actually depend on the current state.

159
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,170
So let's just call this the selected.

160
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:40,210
So the currently selected here in this callback is just called selected so that we don't have to write

161
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:40,960
so much.

162
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,650
Then here we can say if the selected ID is equal.

163
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,970
The friend ID that we're passing in.

164
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:58,260
Then let's set it back to null and otherwise, then set it to the past in front.

165
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:00,440
All right.

166
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,270
So whenever the currently selected let's actually change this here to.

167
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,890
Tucker which stands for Current.

168
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:17,140
So if the currently selected ID is equal to the friended, so the friend that is passed in, then that

169
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:21,970
means that it is actually open so that right now the form is being displayed.

170
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,580
So in that case, we want to actually close it.

171
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,920
And so then we set it back to null.

172
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,640
Right.

173
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,170
So let's try that.

174
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,560
And.

175
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,480
Well, we got a bug.

176
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,410
So let's see what that is.

177
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,050
And yes, this is what I was expecting.

178
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,170
So we cannot read the properties of null.

179
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,670
Right here in the front.

180
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,800
So right here.

181
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,660
And so that is because right now the selected friend is null, isn't it?

182
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,650
And so on.

183
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,070
Null.

184
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,140
We do not have the ID property.

185
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,600
And so therefore then this breaks.

186
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:05,530
But fortunately for us in modern JavaScript, we have optional chaining and so this is very easy to

187
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:06,190
solve.

188
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:12,100
And if you're not familiar with the syntax, then just go back to the section where I review essential

189
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,000
JavaScript.

190
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,420
Now hear this friend will always exist.

191
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,970
And so here we don't need optional chaining.

192
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,610
So we will never run into problems there.

193
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,000
But let's do the same up here as well.

194
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,620
Because again, the currently selected does not always exist.

195
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,410
I mean, sometimes it's null and then.

196
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:34,310
This doesn't work.

197
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,400
Okay, so we select it.

198
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,110
Then we select this.

199
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:45,810
And if I click again, which is what we just implemented, then beautiful.

200
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,500
The form disappeared.

201
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,720
We have no bugs here and everything is back to normal.

202
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:52,770
Great.

203
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:56,820
And now just to finish, let's handle one small edge case.

204
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:02,520
So let's say that we decided to add a friend, but then for some reason, we.

205
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,120
We don't.

206
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,890
We're not interested anymore in this.

207
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,220
And then we click here to open up this form.

208
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,840
So then we have both of them open at the same time, which looks a bit weird.

209
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,700
And so let's automatically close this form here whenever we open this one.

210
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,140
And so this will then again show you the huge power of state.

211
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:28,040
So all we need is one line of code right here where we handle this click.

212
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:34,100
So all we have to do here in handle selection is to select the friend first.

213
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:40,520
And then we set show at friend always to false.

214
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,900
So let's reload that.

215
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,310
So I open the form, then I select Anthony.

216
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,720
And so that closes this one and opens the one that we're interested in.

217
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,920
Great.

218
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,710
And with this, we are now ready to actually make this form here dynamic right in the next video.
