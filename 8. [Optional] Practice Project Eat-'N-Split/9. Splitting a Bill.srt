00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:07,620
Welcome to the last video in this section where we will now finish up the application that we have been

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,310
building.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,600
So in the last lecture, we already made all our elements here, controlled elements.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,650
And so now all we have to do is to listen for the submit event here on this form and then handle it

5
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:23,580
accordingly.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,540
So that's easy enough.

7
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,290
It's always in the same way.

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,300
So onsubmit.

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,860
And then typically we write a handle submit function right here.

10
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,330
So a function handle submit which will receive the event.

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,980
And then as always, we need to do prevent default.

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,160
All right.

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,330
And let's start by adding some guard clauses here.

14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,670
So basically preventing this form from being submitted.

15
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:04,810
If there is no bill or if there is no value paid by the user.

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,480
So in this case, just return and do nothing.

17
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:10,680
Okay.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:18,210
But if there is a bill or a value paid for the user, well, then now it's time to actually split the

19
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:18,720
bill.

20
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,210
Now, in practice, that means basically that the balance of the user in question will be updated.

21
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:31,680
So of the friend here in question, I mean, so whenever we split a bill, it means that this value

22
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,730
right here will be updated.

23
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,470
Right.

24
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,530
So something is clearly happening on the screen.

25
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,850
However, does that mean that we now need a new piece of state?

26
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:49,530
Well, actually, no, because we already have these friends here in our state and all we're doing is

27
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,820
to update them.

28
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:51,960
Right.

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,200
So basically, all we will do is to update this balance value that is displayed here.

30
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:04,780
So let's come again to the component where that state is living.

31
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:10,480
So this state right here and then let's write yet another handler function.

32
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,090
So function handle.

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,850
Split.

34
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,960
Bill, and this one will simply receive a value.

35
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:26,950
So in this case, there is no need to pass in the entire friend because we already know which friend

36
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,480
is going to be updated.

37
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,320
And so that's exactly the current friend, right?

38
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:37,770
But for now, let's actually just log this value here to the console.

39
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,540
So we will take care of this more complex updating logic at the end.

40
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,430
So for now, let's just pass this handle function here into the component.

41
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:51,190
So right into this component here.

42
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:52,600
So on.

43
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,180
Split Bill will be handled by handle.

44
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:00,340
Split Bill.

45
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,290
Okay.

46
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:06,590
Then let's come down here again.

47
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,070
And let's then receive.

48
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:17,710
On split Bill and then finally, we can use that here in order to update the state.

49
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:23,350
Well, for now, we will only log something to the console, but we will take care of updating in a

50
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,980
minute.

51
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:31,270
For now, we first need to figure out exactly with which value we will update the friends balance.

52
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:37,360
And this is actually the most confusing part of this whole application, even more confusing than all

53
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,250
the React stuff itself.

54
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:48,760
So remember that the bill can basically be paid either by you so the user or by the friend.

55
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,660
And so based on that, we now need to set a value.

56
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,120
So we will use the ternary operator here for that.

57
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,840
And so we say who is paying is equal.

58
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,080
To the user, which is basically you.

59
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:11,200
So remember that negative numbers in the balance are owned by you.

60
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:16,870
So by the user and positive numbers means that your friend is owing you.

61
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,020
Therefore, if this here is the situation.

62
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:24,640
So if you are paying, then they will be owing you their part.

63
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,340
And so therefore this is a positive number.

64
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,200
So the value here will be paid by friend.

65
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,050
And in the opposite case.

66
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,940
So if your friend is paying, then you will actually own your part.

67
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:46,960
So the paid by user part and it's going to be a negative value again because the negative values are

68
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,490
the ones owned by you.

69
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,350
So minus.

70
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,560
Paid by user.

71
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,040
And so then inside this function here later we will add that value that we just returned here onto the

72
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,790
balance.

73
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:07,410
So once we're done with all that, I promise this will be a lot easier to understand.

74
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,560
But anyway, let's now come here to our console.

75
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:17,690
Let's just quickly reload here and then let's just try any of these.

76
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:28,780
So let's say the bill is €200 and your part is 50 and Sarah's part is 150 and you are paying the bill.

77
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:35,570
And so the result is then a positive 150, which will be added on top of the balance.

78
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:41,000
So it's plus 150 because it's your friend who is owing you.

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,120
And so, yeah, those are the positive numbers.

80
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:50,350
If we change this here to Sarah, then it will become -50.

81
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,160
So that is your part, which you are then owing to your friend.

82
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,390
And so then it becomes minus and your part.

83
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,900
So -50.

84
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:01,900
All right.

85
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:06,220
So our function here is now receiving that value.

86
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,100
And so now let's update our friend state.

87
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,180
So set friends.

88
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:21,420
And once again, the new array that we will return here will be based on the current friends array.

89
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:23,220
And so here we need that callback.

90
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:33,400
And then what we're going to do is friends dot map because we want to return a new array with the exact

91
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,470
same length as the current one.

92
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:39,570
So that's how we always do it when we update an object in an array.

93
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,040
So we have done that many, many times before.

94
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:48,160
And so if the code I'm going to write next is a bit strange to you, then just feel free to go back

95
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,600
to one of those lectures.

96
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:57,550
But anyway, let's now loop actually over this array in which each of the objects is of course a friend.

97
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:07,400
And so let's then update the friend whenever the current friend ID is equal to the selected friend.id.

98
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:14,660
And so here's what I mentioned earlier, which is that we already know which of the friends is getting

99
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,190
updated, right?

100
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,830
Because we already hold that in the state.

101
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:28,540
So if this is the case, so if the current friend is the one that we want to update, then well, here

102
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:33,640
we are going to return an object which will contain all the elements.

103
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:42,130
So all the properties of the current rent, but we want to override the balance property and we will

104
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,840
override it with.

105
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,720
Friend dot balance.

106
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,160
So the current value plus the value that we received.

107
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,360
And that's it.

108
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,800
So I just saved here by accident.

109
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:02,180
And so immediately we get an error because we're missing the second part of the ternary operator.

110
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:09,510
So here in the second branch of the ternary operator, in case that the current trend is not the one

111
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,670
that we want to update, we simply return that friend unchanged.

112
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,590
And with this, we should now have a working application.

113
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,990
So let's again use the values that we already know so that we used before.

114
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,580
And let's actually still lock the value here to the console.

115
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,540
Just.

116
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,600
So we can better understand what is happening here.

117
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,500
All right.

118
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:44,190
So remember that before Sarah was owing us €20.

119
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,190
And so now see what happens.

120
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:49,720
Now she owes us 170.

121
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:52,610
So that's the 150 that we got.

122
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:59,970
Now, on top of the €20 that she was already owing us before and again, that's because I am paying

123
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,200
the entire bill here.

124
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,950
So it's like I'm lending her so I'm paying her €150, which is her expense.

125
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,960
So her part of the bill.

126
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:20,540
So if we had now a €100 bill where my expense is 90 and then she pays it, then she pays my 90 part

127
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,500
of the bill.

128
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,100
And so then this should become here 100 and or actually it should become 80.

129
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,060
So let's wait for it.

130
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,250
And indeed, now it's 80.

131
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,010
And the same logic can be applied here.

132
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,810
We just need to now reset these values here.

133
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:47,480
So let's say we have a bill of 20, and since Clark is owing me seven or actually you owe Clark those

134
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,470
€7.

135
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,210
Let's now use that here.

136
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:55,130
So here I'm using 13 so that Clark's expense is zero.

137
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,270
And then if I pay, we should be even after this.

138
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:01,940
And indeed, now we are even.

139
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,300
Great.

140
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,440
So this can be a bit confusing, but this is also not really what matters.

141
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:14,160
What matters is all the knowledge, or at least all the practice that we just gained from building this

142
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,510
amazing project.

143
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:21,810
There's just one small thing missing, which is that here the state is not clearing.

144
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,610
So we have two options now.

145
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:30,900
It's to clear the state here in the form, but even better, and which is what I actually do here,

146
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,060
is after.

147
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,670
This is done.

148
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:40,630
So after the bill is split, it will automatically close the form again.

149
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:44,430
And so that's very easy to do, right?

150
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,860
Let's just get rid of this.

151
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:55,080
And then here, thanks to the power of state, once again, we can just say set the selected friend

152
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,210
to null.

153
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,010
And that's going to be it.

154
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:03,630
So once again, very, very easy to do with the power of state.

155
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,320
Imagine doing this kind of stuff with vanilla JavaScript.

156
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:10,650
You would probably become crazy at some point.

157
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,660
So with this, it's super straightforward.

158
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:16,430
Let's just reload here.

159
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,860
Now let's use Anthony here.

160
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:19,430
Let's see.

161
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,420
150.

162
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,960
Our part was like this and it doesn't really matter.

163
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,040
But as I click here, you see that the form disappeared.

164
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,920
And this value here, of course, has changed.

165
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,250
Great.

166
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,190
And with this our application is feature complete.

167
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:41,130
And you just added one more small React app to your portfolio.

168
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,300
So very, very well done.

169
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,760
You are doing great progress here.

170
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:53,200
Now, in order to become even better as we finish this first part of the course, it's very, very important

171
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,050
that you build a lot of similar and small projects just like this one.

172
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:06,430
So it can be something like a shopping list or a simple goal tracker or something like a conference

173
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,650
speaker list where users can select which talks they want to go to.

174
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:17,380
So just some small app like this, it doesn't have to be super fancy or original.

175
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:24,040
Of course, all that matters is that you practice the skills by writing the code without following a

176
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,910
tutorial.

177
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,570
So without following anyone writing the code for you.

178
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:35,810
So I really advise you to not move on to part two before having built something small completely on

179
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,560
your own.

180
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,860
And then once you are done with that, no matter how long that takes, I hope to see you very soon in

181
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,110
that part two of this course.
