1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,630
Okay, so let's begin by rendering the list of friends.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:12,130
And to start, let's again come here to our starter files.

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:19,930
And then inside the Eden split folder, let's get App.js and Index.css.

4
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:22,660
So both of them copy them.

5
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:27,280
And I will just as always change the name here.

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,300
And then inside the source, let's paste them.

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:36,130
And so here we need to replace both of them because they already existed.

8
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:39,640
And then let's delete all the junk files.

9
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,770
So all of these so that we end up only with App.js.

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,550
Index.css and Index.js.

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,850
And so now let's get started by opening up this folder in vs code.

12
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,780
So index.js.

13
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,410
Here we need to, as always, clean up a little bit.

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,300
And then also remove these files that no longer exist.

15
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:12,910
Yeah.

16
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:13,780
And that's it.

17
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,310
So we have our index dot CSS file, which is always please feel free to explore it.

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,990
But our main work is going to happen in App.js.

19
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:36,730
And in fact, let's start by creating the app component, which is as always or main parent component.

20
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:39,460
And here this one we need to export.

21
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,460
Default because this is the component that index.js imports.

22
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,660
Okay, so let's just return some div here.

23
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,130
Hello.

24
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,240
But give it a safe.

25
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,960
And then let's open up the integrated terminal so that we can start up this app.

26
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:10,030
Just make sure that you are in the correct folder here and then just type NPM start, which should then

27
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,730
open a new tab over here.

28
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,940
So let's wait for that.

29
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,730
And indeed, here it is.

30
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:27,320
And yeah, we got our hello, which is nicely centered and that is because of the CSS that I provided

31
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:33,320
and which is as always, automatically included right here already.

32
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,730
So Index.js is importing our index dot CSS.

33
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,720
So that's why these styles are now automatically applied.

34
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:52,400
Now, back here in our code, we see that we have this initial friends array, which as always is simply

35
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,290
an array of objects.

36
00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:00,320
And in this case of some friends where each of them has an ID, a name, an image, which is coming

37
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,610
from this URL here, and then the balance that we saw before.

38
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,900
And more about what these numbers here mean in a minute.

39
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,390
But for now, let's then start building that list of friends component.

40
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:22,440
And here let's again build all the components right into just one file so that we don't have to jump

41
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,790
around all the time.

42
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,050
So, friends.

43
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,700
List.

44
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:36,190
And then here, let's return a list which for now will only contain list.

45
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,160
And so now we will then include this component right here in the app.

46
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,700
So friends list and no props.

47
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:57,030
And here we will now place this into this div with a class name of app which has been provided in the

48
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,110
CSS file.

49
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,590
And then also this should be inside a sidebar.

50
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,170
So another div class name.

51
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:07,160
Sidebar.

52
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,670
Okay.

53
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:17,080
As always, it's a good idea to have the terminal open.

54
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:22,210
And for now, all I'm doing here is to inspect the layout, basically.

55
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,050
So here is that div with the app which you can see is a grid container.

56
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:33,980
And then we have the sidebar and in there we have the Ul, which you can also see is automatically a

57
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,060
flex container.

58
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:43,910
So all this layout stuff, of course, I already did it in advance so that we can focus exclusively

59
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:44,990
on React.

60
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,630
But when you build your own applications in the future, then of course you will have to do all of that

61
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,260
as well.

62
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:59,480
But since this is not a CS course, well, I already wrote it beforehand so that this is a lot faster.

63
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:07,260
But anyway, let's now here actually render these friends that are in this array right here.

64
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,490
So let's for now create a.

65
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,860
Variable called friends.

66
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:21,280
Which we will simply set to the initial friends and later on we will then change this here.

67
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,970
But for now, this is the array that we want to render.

68
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,140
So.

69
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,860
Let's say friends dot map.

70
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:34,730
And by now you should be pretty familiar with this syntax.

71
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,630
So each of the objects is a friend.

72
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,920
And then for now, let's just render a list element and then simply here.

73
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:49,340
With friend dot name.

74
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,950
And indeed, immediately we get Clark, Sarah and Anthony.

75
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,800
So those are our three friends.

76
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:04,010
At least the ones that we want to share a meal with here in this example.

77
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:12,380
Now, we could of course, write the JS right here inside this loop, but since we will have a lot of

78
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,660
code for each of the friends, we should actually move that into a separate component.

79
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,360
And so let's do that.

80
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:23,640
And simply call it for rent.

81
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,730
Well, not like this.

82
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,250
And so this friend should then probably receive the current friend object.

83
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,330
Right?

84
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,540
And so therefore, we accept that here as a prop.

85
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,440
Okay.

86
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,310
And now basically we can move that here.

87
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:50,440
And then here what we want to render is that friend.

88
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:57,470
And into that friend we pass the friend prop with the value of friend.

89
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,420
Close it down.

90
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,550
And then we should also, of course, specify the key prop.

91
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,600
So this unique value that each of the elements in a list needs to have.

92
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,530
And so for that we actually have friend.

93
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,560
Dot ID.

94
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,180
And so as we reload, it looks exactly the same as before.

95
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,800
But we have each friend inside its own component.

96
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,770
And so then we start seeing here our component tree.

97
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,830
So here we still have the error from before.

98
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,880
But now it's gone.

99
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,780
So we already have a small component tree with app friends list.

100
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:41,140
And then in there each friend with their unique key.

101
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:49,730
But now let's keep moving here and let's actually build this list item here, so to make it a bit more

102
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:50,480
complete.

103
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:56,940
So first we have the image of the friend, which is at.

104
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,620
Friend dot image.

105
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:04,430
And then we should also not forget the alt tag.

106
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,480
So here, let's just use the name of the friend.

107
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:17,490
Okay, then we're using an H three element for the name of the friend.

108
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:25,870
And so that's looking already close to the demo right here.

109
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:30,340
The only thing that's missing is this button and then this text here.

110
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:36,730
Let me actually just reload this so that you can see that we have basically these three colors here.

111
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:40,630
So whenever you owe your friend, then the text will be red.

112
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,760
If they owe you, it will be green.

113
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,270
And if you are even, then there is no styling applied.

114
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,960
So let's implement that here.

115
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,420
And so let's see what these numbers here actually mean.

116
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:59,440
So here we have this balance property, and if that's a negative value, that means that you owe your

117
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,040
friend.

118
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,890
So in this case, you owe Clark seven.

119
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:09,070
But if the balance between the two friends is positive like here, then that means that the friend owes

120
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:09,640
you.

121
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:17,190
And so let's now use that knowledge here to do this conditional styling and also this conditional text,

122
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,890
because they are, in fact different.

123
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,920
So let's do friend.

124
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,020
Dot balance.

125
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,790
So if that is negative.

126
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:36,240
Then let's render a paragraph with the class name of red.

127
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,880
Saying you.

128
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,940
Oh, and then the name of the friend.

129
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,400
Dot name.

130
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,420
But then.

131
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,860
Friend dot balance.

132
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,900
And then zero, which I don't really know how to type.

133
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:59,070
On the keyboard that I'm using.

134
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,130
And so let's just copy it from here.

135
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:07,800
Or of course you can also use the dollar sign like this, so that doesn't really matter.

136
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,910
But what matters is that now we have this text here.

137
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:12,880
Here.

138
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,240
We just want to remove that negative sign.

139
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,810
So let's actually do.

140
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:24,610
Math dot apps, which stands for Absolute, and that's a bit nicer.

141
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,230
Okay.

142
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,230
And now let's copy this three times.

143
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:37,370
And so here I decided to basically use three times the end operator for conditional rendering instead

144
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,010
of a nested ternary.

145
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,640
So we could also have done this condition right here with a ternary operator.

146
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:49,580
And then in the else branch we could have another ternary operator for these two cases here.

147
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:55,880
So friends balance greater than zero or equal zero.

148
00:10:55,880 --> 00:11:03,740
But since these three cases are mutually exclusive, it's easier to simply have three times this end.

149
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:06,560
And so then only one of these will apply.

150
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:10,840
But anyway, here it is, green.

151
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,240
And here we have no class at all.

152
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,850
So no special styling.

153
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,380
And here, let's say you and.

154
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,390
Your friend.

155
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,130
Or even.

156
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,200
Okay.

157
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,880
And now here we need to also change the text to your friend.

158
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,050
Owes you €20.

159
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,300
And so that's, in fact, exactly what we have here.

160
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,300
Now all we are missing is the button here on the right side.

161
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,220
And that's easy enough.

162
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,370
Just button with the class.

163
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,650
Name of button.

164
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,270
And then.

165
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,040
Select.

166
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,800
And there we go.

167
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,000
That's our list of friends.
