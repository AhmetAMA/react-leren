1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:04,050
To finish part one of this course.

2
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:11,760
So the React fundamentals will review everything we have learned up until this point by building this

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,000
brand new project called Eaton Split.

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:23,400
Now, since this is a bonus practice project, it doesn't introduce any new concepts, and so you can

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:26,670
safely skip it if you're pressed for time.

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:36,450
However, in my experience, practicing these fundamentals of state props and events is absolutely crucial

7
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:43,920
for your progress and also to understand all the content that follows in the rest of the course.

8
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:51,990
So if you can make sure to build this project together with me now, or you can even try it completely

9
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:52,890
on your own.
