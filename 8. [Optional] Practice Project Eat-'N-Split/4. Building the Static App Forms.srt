1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,540
So we already built two of the four components that we identified.

2
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,550
And so next, let's build the two forms.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,240
So that's this form right here.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,750
And then the main bill splitting form.

5
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,440
But we will start with this small and easy one down here.

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:22,400
So back to our app.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,800
Let's create.

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:29,200
The next component, which is called form.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,280
Ad for rent.

10
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:41,830
So here, let's return a form element with the class name of form.

11
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,110
At friend.

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,290
So just the same as the component name itself.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,360
Let's have one label which says.

14
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,000
Friend.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,810
Name.

16
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,720
Then let's hear at.

17
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:04,060
Uh, one emoji with like, two people, for example, here.

18
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,410
Like this.

19
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,650
And then the actual input field.

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,370
Of the type text and that's it.

21
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,290
So again, we are just building the static part so we have no state here.

22
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,960
So for now, this element here is of course not a controlled element yet.

23
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,370
So here.

24
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:32,940
Next up, let's have the image URL.

25
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,480
And again, I will use some emoji here.

26
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,620
Let's go for this one.

27
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,300
And then here, basically, we can just duplicate this line of text for now.

28
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,480
I stopped giving that a save.

29
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,910
And finally, we need a button again.

30
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,030
So that's this button element with the class.

31
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,220
Name of button.

32
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:58,940
So now we could just copy this here and paste it here.

33
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,580
This class name button.

34
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:06,470
So now we could just copy this here and paste it down here.

35
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:13,430
But since we need a button like this multiple times throughout the user interface, we can just actually

36
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:15,980
place this here into its own component.

37
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,340
So we need to reuse this code right here.

38
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,780
And so we just identified a new component that we need.

39
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,750
All right.

40
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,770
And here, let's do exactly what we did before.

41
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:42,380
So we will specify the children prop because that content of the button will come into the button via

42
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,640
this children prop.

43
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,650
So then we just display it here.

44
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:54,700
So remember that the children proper here will be whatever is between the opening tag and the closing

45
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,490
tag of calling the component.

46
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,800
So now we say button.

47
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,570
And then here, just as before we say select.

48
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,380
And so this here is then the children of this button, basically.

49
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:13,340
So the children props right here will be select in this case.

50
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,000
And so indeed, everything works just as before.

51
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,990
And now we can then use the same button here, but this time the text will be Add.

52
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,220
All right.

53
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,550
And we can't see the result of this yet because we, of course, need to include it also here in the

54
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,920
app in the sidebar.

55
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:38,640
So form add friend.

56
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,990
And there it is.

57
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,260
So all we're missing now, here is some button.

58
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,890
So you see that Here we have this button which says Add friend.

59
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,580
And so whenever we click this button, then the form will open.

60
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:00,660
But again, for now, our app is not dynamic like this, but we still want the add friend button there.

61
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,350
So right here between these two.

62
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,790
And so we use again, our button component.

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,500
And so you see that this is a lot more comfortable than always having to use the normal button element

64
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,920
with the button class attached to it.

65
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:25,020
So here we used that class once right here, and then we can reuse that button with the class over and

66
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,830
over again.

67
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,500
Add friend.

68
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,510
Well, that looks a bit weird.

69
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:36,110
I believe that the button actually should be after.

70
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,120
All right.

71
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,070
So, in fact, this is what we get here when we click.

72
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,610
So the button change the text to close and it is below.

73
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,060
All right, let's just give ourselves a bit more space.

74
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,430
And then let's move on to building this other main form over here.

75
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,900
So that one is called.

76
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,720
The form split Bill.

77
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,220
Form split.

78
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,410
A bill.

79
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:23,400
And then let's again return a form element with the class name equal to the component name.

80
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:28,160
So form split Bill, but not in Camelcase.

81
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,600
But in this other case, that's more common in CSS.

82
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,190
So first we have the title Split a Bill.

83
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:40,750
With.

84
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:47,740
And then here actually the name of the friend, which means that we will at some point need to pass

85
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,320
in the friend object here into this component.

86
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:57,130
But for now, we can't really do that because we don't have a way yet of selecting one of the friends

87
00:05:57,130 --> 00:06:00,300
and then passing that friend object into the form.

88
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,530
So that is what we will do later.

89
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:06,310
But for now, let's just place some placeholder here.

90
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,540
Okay.

91
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:12,250
And then before we keep going, let's include that form into the app.

92
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,910
And that's outside the sidebar here.

93
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:20,080
So just here inside app form split Bill.

94
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,480
And there it is.

95
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:29,480
So let's move back down here and then write the actual content of this form.

96
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,720
And actually this is pretty similar to what we have here.

97
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,670
So I'll just grab this part and paste that here.

98
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,210
And then all we need to do is to change the text here.

99
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:44,990
So first we have the bill value.

100
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:49,250
Then use some money emoji here.

101
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,600
Of course, here the text is also different.

102
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,520
It's split.

103
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,510
Bill And then let's copy just this part.

104
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:02,490
Paste it here twice.

105
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:08,330
So your expenses or expense.

106
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,250
Yet another emoji.

107
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,220
And of course you can split those if you don't want.

108
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,610
And now here the expense of your friend.

109
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,610
So I'll again just use X for now.

110
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:38,590
And then we want that emoji of two people that we had before to symbolize that this is the friend.

111
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,770
Okay.

112
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,120
Nice.

113
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,880
And let's see.

114
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,800
And in fact, the only thing that we are missing is now this select here.

115
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,940
And also this input right here should be disabled.

116
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:59,750
So when we add something here, for example, our expense is 40.

117
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:05,960
Then we should not be allowed to change Clark's expense because otherwise these two values wouldn't

118
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,570
add up to the total bill value.

119
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,380
So let's do that.

120
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,640
So here we can simply use the disabled attribute.

121
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,130
So that's very simple.

122
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,230
And you saw that it become grayed out there.

123
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,300
Then I'll.

124
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,280
Let's then write.

125
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,740
Debt select.

126
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:36,290
So here, another money emoji for specifying who is paying.

127
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,400
The bill.

128
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:45,030
And then here we have a very simple select element with only two options.

129
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,570
So option one is you.

130
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,510
And here let's actually specify the value also as user.

131
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,690
And then in this other one as the friend.

132
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,740
And then here we again want the friend name.

133
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,420
So let's use X.

134
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,870
And nice.

135
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,090
Yep, that works.

136
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,100
And so with this, we actually finished building the static part of the application.

137
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:24,610
And so next up, we are finally ready to start adding some dynamics, so to add some state here.
