1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,760
Let's now make our application feature complete by adding a button to clear up the entire list at once.

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:18,070
And so to do that, let's come down here and after the select, we're going to add a simple button.

3
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:24,710
So not like that, but button clear list.

4
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,500
So there it is.

5
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:33,170
And now, as always, we need to add the onClick event handler, and then we need a function that basically

6
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,740
deletes all of these elements here at once.

7
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,200
Now, I think that this might be a nice challenge for you.

8
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:46,160
So creating that function, that deletes everything and then passing that function down to this component

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,440
and adding it here onto the button.

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,860
So that shouldn't be all too hard.

11
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,200
And so please go ahead and pause the video right now.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:00,080
So try this on your own, really, as this is a really nice learning experience and then I see you back

13
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:04,610
here in a minute or five once you are finished with that task.

14
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:07,490
Okay.

15
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:13,890
So I will create a function close to all the other functions.

16
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:22,320
So we have handle add items, delete and toggle, and so we simply add just another one.

17
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:25,380
So handle clear.

18
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:29,460
List, which doesn't need anything, really.

19
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:39,350
And then all we need to do here is to simply say set items back to the original value, which was,

20
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,480
of course, this empty array.

21
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,170
And that's it.

22
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,750
So that's almost too simple.

23
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:52,870
But now we just need to connect this function to the button so that button is in the packing list.

24
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,850
So that's where we pass this into a prop.

25
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,160
So on.

26
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,870
Clear list.

27
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,700
Will be.

28
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,680
Handle clear list.

29
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,780
And so now let's get that.

30
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:14,680
So this packing list really receives a lot of props.

31
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,320
And so then here.

32
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,120
The onClick prop.

33
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,970
And here we don't even need to create a new function.

34
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,720
All we have to do is to pass this one in.

35
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:32,230
So on clear list.

36
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,370
Give it a save.

37
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,080
And that should be it.

38
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:39,130
So clear list and yes, everything is gone.

39
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:40,600
Great.

40
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,130
So I'm hoping that you did this as well.

41
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,030
And now just one more thing here is that here in this demo app is that here we prevent the user from

42
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,030
accidentally deleting everything.

43
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,150
So here when they click on clear list, first we get if we want to delete all the items and only then

44
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,570
if we click on okay, everything will get deleted.

45
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,990
So you see, now it is empty.

46
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,860
So let's quickly do the same thing here.

47
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,990
And that's pretty easy because that's just a standard dumb function.

48
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:22,690
So that's a function that's not really part of JavaScript, but it's part of the web API.

49
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,990
But anyway, here we can create.

50
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:34,190
Some variable, let's say confirmed, and then that confirmed will be defined by window dot.

51
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,870
Confirm.

52
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,660
So here we can then pass in any string.

53
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:43,340
So that's going to be the the message that the user will see.

54
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,930
So are you sure?

55
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,190
You want to delete all items?

56
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:57,520
And then when the user clicks on, okay, confirmed will become true and in the case they click cancel,

57
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,810
then it will be false.

58
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,270
And so now we can do this conditionally.

59
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,400
So we just say if.

60
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:06,000
Confirmed.

61
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,850
Then set items to the empty array.

62
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,830
Just to make sure let's reload.

63
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,730
And shorts and a charger.

64
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,130
And now when I clear the list.

65
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,740
Then, yes, we got the confirm and it works beautifully.

66
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,810
Now, maybe you got a little bit annoyed at all the scrolling that we had to do here.

67
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,730
Now lately, because our components were getting bigger and bigger.

68
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,790
So whenever we wanted like to pass in something here, then we had to scroll all the way down here to

69
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:41,820
then accept, for example, these props right here.

70
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:48,660
And so that's why I said in the very beginning that in real world applications we usually have one component

71
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,620
per file.

72
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:56,880
And so in the next lecture, I will show you a trick of how we can basically divide this one file into

73
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,110
multiple files.

74
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,330
So one file per component.
