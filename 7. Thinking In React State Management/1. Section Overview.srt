00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,170
Welcome back.

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:10,290
In the following section, we'll start looking at a core skill that every React developer needs to develop

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,160
right from the beginning.

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,410
And that core skill is to think in react.

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:25,290
Now, thinking in React encompasses many different aspects, but in this section we'll focus on state

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,310
management.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:35,070
So you will learn when and where to create state variables, when and how to derive state, and also

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:41,190
how to communicate between child and parent components by lifting state up.

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:48,210
And all these new skills will be needed as we keep building our faraway application.

10
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,280
So get ready for some more foundational react knowledge.

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,160
And so let's dive right in.
