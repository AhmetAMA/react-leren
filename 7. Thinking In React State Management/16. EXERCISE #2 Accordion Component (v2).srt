1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:06,760
Let's now take everything that we learned throughout this section in order to make the accordion that

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,650
we started building earlier a bit better and a bit more real world.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,110
And here it is.

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:19,410
So just like before, when I click on one of the items, then it will open.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:26,610
But when I click on another one, then only this one stays open and all the other ones are closed.

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:34,200
So basically what this means is that now each of the items no longer controls whether there are open

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,950
or not.

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,290
Instead, it is now the accordion.

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:45,100
Who knows which of the items are opened and then only that item basically is allowed to be open.

10
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,860
So, for example, if item number three is the one that's currently opened, then number one, two and

11
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,020
23 need to be closed.

12
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:01,440
So again, all of these items here need to know which is the currently open item.

13
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:09,390
And so that means that we now need to move our state from the item onto here, the accordion.

14
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:20,020
Now, I still have the code here from the part one of the exercise and to let me now fork this so I

15
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,990
can basically leave the other part unchanged.

16
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,740
But you can totally also work on top of version one.

17
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,540
So then you only have that one.

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:37,480
So let's now remove this piece of state, because again, now each item no longer controls whether it

19
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,710
is open or not.

20
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,310
And then we get a bunch of errors.

21
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,900
But that's not a problem for now at least.

22
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:54,970
So here, let's now create that piece of state I was talking about which will be current open.

23
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,260
And so here we will store the number of the item that is currently open.

24
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:03,080
Set is open.

25
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,260
Use state and we will start with Null.

26
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,260
So then none of them will be open in the beginning.

27
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:17,030
So again, this open state variable will basically hold the number.

28
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,620
So this number right here of the item that is currently open.

29
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:29,630
And so then we pass that open into the accordion item and then from there it can calculate whether it

30
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,730
is currently open or not.

31
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:35,150
So let's do that.

32
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,200
Let's pass.

33
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,400
Open in.

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,970
So we use a prop called open to pass that in.

35
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:51,110
And then we also need to pass this setter function in so that then down here in the item, we can set

36
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,140
the current item to the one that has been clicked.

37
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:02,030
And here let's use the convention we used before, which is to start with the on prefix.

38
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:04,240
So let's say on open.

39
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,710
Set is open.

40
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,970
And now here, let's then receive those props.

41
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,950
So cut open and on.

42
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,000
Open.

43
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:21,350
Here.

44
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:26,420
Let's for now just comment this out to get rid of this error right there.

45
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:32,630
And then here, as I was saying, we can basically calculate whether this item is currently opened or

46
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,260
not.

47
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,370
So we can say again is open.

48
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:39,170
So bringing back the variable name from before.

49
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,660
And then if the number.

50
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:47,600
So if the number of this item is equal to the currently open one.

51
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:56,860
So in that case is open will be true, and then it will be well displayed as open.

52
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,850
So let's change this here from null to one.

53
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,630
And so that works.

54
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,940
So remember that this one add one.

55
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,060
And so this is zero one and two.

56
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,660
So if I set to.

57
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,680
Then that one is open.

58
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,670
And then.

59
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:15,720
What?

60
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,300
Zero.

61
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,800
The first one is open.

62
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,500
Great.

63
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:22,800
So we created a state variable.

64
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,580
We used it in the UI this time by passing it into the item and then using it to compute whether the

65
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,480
item is currently the open one or if it's not.

66
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:41,360
All right, let's set this back to Null because, of course, now we want to update the state by clicking

67
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,100
on each of these.

68
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,590
So that's right here.

69
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:48,950
So let's get rid of all that and then let's.

70
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,920
I use our on open function.

71
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,950
And here it's very simple.

72
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,770
All we want to do is to pass in the number.

73
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:07,740
So, for example, if we are here in item number one, then when we click on open, we'll run with number

74
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:08,310
one.

75
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:17,190
And remember that on open is basically set is open, which should be called set current open.

76
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,740
All right.

77
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,900
So we run it with number one.

78
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,020
And so then the state cur open becomes one.

79
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:30,540
And then what happens down here again is that one is equal to one.

80
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:36,270
And so then that item will become open and all the other ones will stay closed.

81
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,550
For example, this one here, item zero.

82
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,880
Well, item zero is different than one.

83
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,220
So is open is false.

84
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,350
And that works beautifully.

85
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,860
Great.

86
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:57,730
And I know this can be pretty confusing because we're passing state up and down, but this is basically

87
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,190
just the idea of lifting up state.

88
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:06,730
So before we had the state right here in each item, but then suddenly all of them need to know about

89
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,660
the current state.

90
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,460
And so therefore, we can say that we lifted state up to the closest parent.

91
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:14,800
All right.

92
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,500
So after this exercise is done, please take some time to analyze the data flow here in great detail.

93
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,690
I'm just moving a bit faster here because we already learned about all of this.

94
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,940
And this is just an exercise.

95
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:35,550
Okay, Now, next up, what I want to do is to use our knowledge about the children prop.

96
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:44,350
So instead of passing the text in here like this, it's actually a lot nicer to define the text basically

97
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,520
as content.

98
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,950
So let's pass that text in here.

99
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,620
So l dot text.

100
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,440
And let's close this.

101
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,260
And indeed, now the text is temporarily gone.

102
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,310
So we no longer need this prop here, but we need the children prop, which I'd like to add either to

103
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,770
the end or to the beginning of this list.

104
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:14,180
And then here, that's no longer text but children.

105
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,800
Yeah, that works great.

106
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,890
And with this, we are a lot more flexible when it comes to the kind of content that should be displayed

107
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,480
in each of the items.

108
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,600
So let's add one manually here.

109
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,990
And so that's where that 23 comes from in the demo that I showed you earlier.

110
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:42,640
So outside this loop, let's now create just one, one test, one here, test one.

111
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,550
And this should actually be a string, I guess.

112
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,290
The number, let's say 22.

113
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:54,530
Here.

114
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,060
Let's again repeat the title.

115
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,850
And as for the content, let's just come here and copy this.

116
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,080
You can write it by hand if you want, or you can just write really whatever you want.

117
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,570
So just wrapping this here in a.

118
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,140
This one in a Ul.

119
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,310
And each of these here simply one lie.

120
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:33,810
So just I mean, this is not really necessary.

121
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,940
This is just to show you.

122
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,890
Okay.

123
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:49,750
And so if we click here now, you see that we are able to pass in this entire JSX as the content.

124
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:52,930
And so that's again thanks to the children prop.

125
00:08:53,110 --> 00:09:02,230
So here of course we only have text, but yeah, here we have this entire piece of HTML basically.

126
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:08,980
And of course our entire functionality here of the accordion still works just like before, so we can

127
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:11,920
only have one of them open at the same time.

128
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:19,570
Now there's just one small thing missing, which is that when we click here on an opened one, it doesn't

129
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:21,130
close, right?

130
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,690
So probably you can see that for yourself.

131
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:33,680
And so what we need to do now is to basically set the state to null whenever it is opened already.

132
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,400
So when we click here and it is already open.

133
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:39,670
Then.

134
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,550
The new state.

135
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:48,630
So the new current open should become null and only otherwise it should be the number.

136
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,690
And so that will fix it.

137
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,500
Indeed.

138
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,910
Great.

139
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,210
So that exercise is finished as well.

140
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:58,950
And I hope you found it useful.

141
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:05,760
And now, as I said before, please take some time to analyze the code and the data flow right here

142
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,960
in this component.

143
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,780
And then once you're done, you are ready for the mandatory coding challenge in this section.
