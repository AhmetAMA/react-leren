1
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:07,000
Next up, let's take care of updating items by toggling their pact status.

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,650
So basically that's the functionality that I showed you by the end of the previous lecture.

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,670
Right.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,850
So this is what we want to implement in our app now.

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,770
And so to start, we actually need to create those checkboxes there.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,480
So right now, we don't even have that checkbox.

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,850
And so let's go here to our item and before the span.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,680
Let's now add.

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,710
An input of the type.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,680
And here we want a string.

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,480
So of the type checkbox.

12
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,090
So that's something.

13
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,640
So we can actually already toggle this one here on and off now.

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,430
But of course it's not going to do anything.

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:02,150
So basically we want to also transform this element right here into a controlled element.

16
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:08,720
And remember, a controlled element means that the element has the value defined by some state, and

17
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,120
it also has an event handler which listens for the change and updates the state accordingly.

18
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,050
So let's do those two things.

19
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:25,870
And first the value will be given by the item dot checked status.

20
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:30,070
And so this checked here is always a true or false value.

21
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,770
And so that is exactly the type of value that we need to pass into the value of a checkbox.

22
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:41,770
And actually here it should be packed and not checked, which maybe you had already noticed.

23
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,770
But anyway, now let's keep going here.

24
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,820
And so now next up, we need to add Onchange handler.

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:55,180
So we need to listen for the change event, which basically happens each time that we click here on

26
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,230
the checkbox.

27
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:01,450
Now here for now, let's actually specify just an empty function.

28
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,030
So a function that doesn't do anything.

29
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,550
And here we're missing this.

30
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:07,480
All right.

31
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:13,300
And so the reason for that is that, of course, this function here that we are eventually going to

32
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,610
specify here is going to change the packed value of the item state.

33
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,510
Right.

34
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:25,050
And so that function will once again be placed where the state actually lives.

35
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:32,080
So inside of app and then we will pass it down using a prop just like we did with on delete item.

36
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,120
So this is something similar.

37
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:38,740
So instead of deleting an item, we will simply now update one item.

38
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,260
And so again, that updates happens each time that we click here on the checkbox.

39
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,910
So let's now write that function here.

40
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:56,790
So function and again, starting with the handle keyword and then toggle item.

41
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:01,220
And that's because here we will only toggle the packed property.

42
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:08,160
So not allow anyone to update the entire object, but only really to change the value of that packed

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,000
property.

44
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:17,280
So in order to know which object we actually need to change, we need to again pass in the ID And so

45
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,820
then.

46
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:26,070
Let's again set the items and then we need to pass in a new array, which just like before, will depend

47
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,690
on the current array.

48
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,450
So we have our callback function here.

49
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:38,370
And so now in order to update one of the objects in the array, we will simply loop over the entire

50
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:45,330
items array using the map property, which will then in the end return a brand new array with the same

51
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,290
length of the initial items array.

52
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:52,110
But one of the objects will then of course have been updated.

53
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,090
So in the iteration each of the elements is called an item.

54
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,190
And then here is what we're going to do.

55
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:08,100
So whenever the item has the ID that is equal to the ID that we passed in, so which means that this

56
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:13,530
is the object that we want to actually update, then we create a brand new object.

57
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,720
Based on the current item.

58
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,630
And then we set packed.

59
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,980
To the opposite of packed.

60
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,520
So if item dot packed and that's it.

61
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,220
And if else so for all the other objects we will simply return the current item.

62
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,650
And just once again, I want to emphasize that I covered exactly that.

63
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:46,760
This is how we update an object in an array in great depth in the section where we review essential

64
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,350
JavaScript for React.

65
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:51,860
So please go there in case that this looks strange.

66
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:56,460
But for everyone else, let's just keep going here.

67
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:05,000
And now also add this function here into the packing list so that the packing list can then edit into

68
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,690
the item.

69
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,820
So we use once again the props basically as a communication channel here.

70
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,240
So on toggle items.

71
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,580
Handle toggle item.

72
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,060
So on toggle item right here and now, let's just copy this edit here to the list of props.

73
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:33,940
Exactly like this, and then we pass it into the item itself.

74
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,320
Let's do that here.

75
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,330
All right.

76
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,550
And finally, we receive it here.

77
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:50,880
So again, we need to use the packing list here as an intermediary step in order to reach the item itself.

78
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:59,220
And so now here we can then replace this empty function with calling on toggle item with just like before

79
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,650
the current ID so that we actually know which is the object that we need to change.

80
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,360
All right.

81
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,550
And that's actually it.

82
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,410
Or at least it should be.

83
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:12,360
So let's see if that works.

84
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,160
So one sucks.

85
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,690
Let's say one shirt and one charger.

86
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,660
And now as we click here.

87
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,560
Yeah, beautiful.

88
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,010
So it updates or checkbox and you see that it also updates here the strikethrough.

89
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:35,640
So that's coming exactly here from when the item is packed and the same of course works for all the

90
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:41,400
other ones because if we click on this one then the item ID will be another one.

91
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,780
And so therefore then this function here receives another value which will then update another object.

92
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,780
And deleting here of course also works.

93
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:59,070
And so yeah, we are done with building these two operations that we can perform on items.

94
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:07,390
So toggling their packed status and deleting them now before moving on, please just make sure to review

95
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:09,310
the code that we wrote here.

96
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,980
So just to make sure that you understand basically everything that's happening here, why we are doing

97
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,880
it this way.

98
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:23,410
And yeah, the way we then pass in these functions as props all the way down until the components that

99
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:24,580
actually need them.

100
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,950
So this is again child to parent communication, which is something that we're going to use all the

101
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:30,400
time.

102
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:36,430
And so make sure that you really understand this concept as well as lifting up state until you move

103
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:40,930
on to the next lecture, which is going to be about derived state.
