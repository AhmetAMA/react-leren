1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,410
So let's now split up our app.js file into multiple component files.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,660
And this will just be a very simple exercise of taking each of these components and placing them into

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:14,740
their own file.

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,340
So you can even do that on your own if you want.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:25,510
But anyway, let's just grab this code here, cut it and then create a new file inside source.

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:34,180
So inside this source folder, create logo dot JS, which is the name of this component, right?

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,740
All right.

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:41,480
But now, of course, we also have to export this function from here.

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,680
And remember that in JavaScript we can export in two ways.

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,750
So we can have named exports, which would simply be this.

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,390
So with this we would create an export called logo, which we would then have to import with exactly

12
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,850
that name into the other file.

13
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,650
So into the file where we need it.

14
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,660
But usually in React apps, what we do is to use a default export.

15
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:09,530
So export default just like this.

16
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:16,610
And then of course now if we try to reload this, we will get an error that well, not this one.

17
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:17,230
Yeah.

18
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,050
Right here.

19
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:20,630
So we see that the logo is not defined.

20
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,740
And so of course that's because now we have to import it right here.

21
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:27,580
So import.

22
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,410
And here actually we can use any name that we want.

23
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:36,200
So because we used a default export, but of course we will still call it logo here.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,800
So import logo from and then simply the path.

25
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,450
To dead file.

26
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,630
And yes.

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,960
And again, we could indeed change the name here to X.

28
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,760
For example, and then here as well.

29
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,110
Give it a save.

30
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,020
And you see that it still works.

31
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:58,150
But again, this is, of course, not advisable.

32
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,280
This is just to show you how named and how default exports work.

33
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,550
All right.

34
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:08,110
Now let's take the next one.

35
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:13,870
And by the way, the first one here will, of course, stay in this file because it is called app.

36
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,410
And this file is also already called App.js.

37
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,480
So let's grab the next one here.

38
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,050
Okay, cut it.

39
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:28,520
New file form dot JS.

40
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,710
Paste it here and then again.

41
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,470
Export default.

42
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,730
Coming back here, then we need to import.

43
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,890
Form from.

44
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,440
Just like this.

45
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:54,280
Now, here we will still get an error because we haven't imported use state in that other component.

46
00:02:54,910 --> 00:03:00,400
So let's quickly grab this line of code here, move into the form, which is where we are using use

47
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,060
state.

48
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:04,240
And then we also need to import that hook.

49
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:11,830
So this use state function here into this file, of course, because this file here does use that function.

50
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,560
So it's not enough to just include it one time.

51
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,950
Anywhere in the code, you really have to include the parts of react that you need in each single component

52
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,550
file.

53
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,960
So let's close this one and this one.

54
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,070
And now that we have done it two times manually, it's actually time to do it automatically.

55
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,960
So let's again select all of this.

56
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,100
We can even click this triangle here to collapse the function.

57
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,170
And so then we can select all of it.

58
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,630
And then right click here.

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,700
And then click on refactor.

60
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:51,630
And so now here, this gives us the option to move this function into a new file.

61
00:03:52,360 --> 00:04:00,700
So let's click that and you see that a brand new file with the name of Packing List was created.

62
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:09,150
So vs code automatically took this function here and then created a new file with this exact same name

63
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,340
and it also automatically imported all the parts that we need inside this function.

64
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:18,090
So we have used state and we also have item.

65
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:25,530
Well, this actually doesn't make a lot of sense at this point because the item is still here.

66
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,260
So that's actually not ideal.

67
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,150
But we will fix that in a moment.

68
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:37,810
So what matters here for now is that VS code automatically created this new file placed this new component

69
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,330
here and also exported it.

70
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,830
Now it's actually using a named export.

71
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,360
So you can see here that it's importing it in this other way.

72
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,620
So this is how you do a named import.

73
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:56,910
But again, we usually in React development do default exports.

74
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,000
But of course the other way is also perfectly fine.

75
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,040
So we'll just change it here.

76
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,440
Export default.

77
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:08,430
And then here I need to change the way I import it.

78
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,090
So getting rid of these curly braces.

79
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,630
And now let's also create a new component for this item here.

80
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:19,150
So let's just remove this export.

81
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,990
Select everything.

82
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,930
Refactor.

83
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,690
And move to a new file.

84
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,980
So again, item was created.

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,370
And here we need to actually write export.

86
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,900
Default, give it a save.

87
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:43,960
And now we need to change that in the pecking list because now this component is no longer in app but

88
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,040
inside.

89
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,840
Well instead of items.

90
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,050
It's again a default export.

91
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,860
So we need to import it basically as a default import.

92
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:58,620
All right.

93
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:05,700
So this small thing here happened because we first exported the packing list, which depended on the

94
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,330
item.

95
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:13,300
But in any case, usually we do this immediately.

96
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:19,480
So usually when we build some app, we do immediately create a new file for when we need a new component.

97
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,980
So let's do that one final time.

98
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,950
So stats.

99
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,780
Let's change it again to export.

100
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,830
Default just to stay consistent.

101
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:36,460
And then fix it here as well.

102
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:43,270
And with this, we now have one component per file which makes our component here a little bit easier

103
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,990
to manage.

104
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:50,320
So then there's not so much scrolling up and down, but instead, well, we can develop basically each

105
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,350
component in isolation in its separate file.

106
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:01,280
Now, taking it one step further, we can also move each of the components into a new components folder.

107
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,740
So components.

108
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,920
And then let's select all of them, actually.

109
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:14,990
So everything except for Index.js, which is not a component and our CSS file.

110
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:24,530
Grab them here and now we only have one problem, which is the app file cannot be found here in Index.js.

111
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,860
So here we need to now fix this path to.

112
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,460
Components slash app.

113
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,350
And with this we are finished.

114
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,200
So all the other files still work the same.

115
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,310
Or actually this one here.

116
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:47,270
So here the imports still work because all the components are still in the same folder as App.js.

117
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:51,000
And with this, we actually finished this project.

118
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:58,550
So once again, congratulations for finishing your first a bit more real React project.

119
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:01,370
So a project that actually does something.

120
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:08,270
So I think this was a really great practice project, quite straightforward, but it had all the most

121
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,300
important fundamentals that you needed to know at this stage.

122
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:18,440
Now, of course this is not a real world application, but in large scale apps you actually have many

123
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:22,010
smaller parts in which you will need exactly these skills.

124
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:26,110
And so everything that you are learning here is really, really important.

125
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:32,870
It will lay the foundation so that later you can build those large and real world applications.

126
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:39,060
Now, next up in this section, we have a nice exercise where together we're going to build an accordion

127
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:39,860
component.

128
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:45,120
And then I just want to show you one other very important part of React.

129
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,250
So that's going to be the children prop.

130
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,490
And so, yeah, stay tuned for that.
