1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:06,950
Let's now make our watched movies list work and let's do it all in one go.

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,210
So this is going to be a long one.

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,850
And so let's quickly get started.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:19,980
And let's actually get started by quickly recapping what this watch list actually is.

5
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:26,910
So remember how we already have this watch state here, which right now is this empty array, but it

6
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,070
used to be this.

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:31,960
Temp watched data.

8
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:34,520
So let's close this here.

9
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,750
And so you see that?

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:43,040
Then we had these two movies with a few details with the user rating and then also this summary right

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:43,580
here.

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:52,900
Now, of course, we will start from zero here and then we can add each of the movies here to our list.

13
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,060
So they will then appear over there.

14
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,440
So we already have the list component.

15
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,830
So it should be somewhere down here.

16
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,200
So we have the watch summary.

17
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,300
We have the watched movie list and we have the watched movie itself.

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:19,190
So each of these movies needs the poster, the title, the rating, the user rating and the runtime.

19
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:24,910
So basically we need to create a brand new object for each of these movies.

20
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:33,060
And then pass each of these objects here into this watched array.

21
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:41,780
So actually, let's start by creating that function with which we can add a new item to that array.

22
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,270
So let's call it handle ad watch.

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,310
Then we get a movie.

24
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,990
Let's call this watched.

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,580
And then let's do it as always.

26
00:01:53,580 --> 00:02:02,010
So we call, set, watched, and then we get the current watched movies array, and then we create a

27
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:04,620
brand new one based on that one.

28
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,010
So based on all the elements of that array.

29
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:11,330
And then the brand new movie object.

30
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,330
Okay.

31
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,690
And now we just need to pass that in.

32
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:23,890
So again, as a prop and you see that this component is getting really big at the same for this entire

33
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,510
file.

34
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,440
So if you want, feel free to split up this file into multiple files.

35
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,630
So one component per file.

36
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:34,570
But anyway, I will just keep working here.

37
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,030
That's all.

38
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,160
Let's pass that function that we just created here as on Add.

39
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,820
What?

40
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,110
Handle at what?

41
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:52,920
So we're passing that into movie details because again, that is where we will actually have the button

42
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,800
to add the movie to the watch list.

43
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,450
So it will be right here.

44
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:03,660
And so then here in this component, we set the state, it will get updated in the parent and from there

45
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,630
it goes back here into the statistics and then into this list, of course.

46
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,880
Okay, but now let's then move to the movie details component and let's add a button.

47
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,690
Right here.

48
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,150
So under this rating.

49
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,980
So here, let's say.

50
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:32,470
Button with the class name of BTN add.

51
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,420
And then add.

52
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,650
To list.

53
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:44,490
Now here, of course, we need our event handler and let's actually create a.

54
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:50,720
Another event handler right here, which will then call the one that we passed into the component.

55
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:56,000
Because here we actually need to do a lot of stuff.

56
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:01,650
So function handle add.

57
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:09,200
And so again, this one will then eventually call that function that we passed here as a prop.

58
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,570
So that was on ad watched.

59
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:24,560
So again, in the end, we will call that function here, which remember, needs a new movie object

60
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,700
as the input.

61
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,420
So new movie basically.

62
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,490
So like a new watched movie.

63
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,670
So let's create that object here.

64
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,990
Let's actually call it new watched movie, just so we understand what we are doing here.

65
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:52,600
So this movie object will also need an IMDb rating, and here we can simply use the one that is currently

66
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,470
selected.

67
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:00,820
So the currently selected ID is of course the IMDb rating of that movie that we are going to add.

68
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:09,010
Then remember, we also need the title, of course, of the movie The Year, the Poster.

69
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:15,270
The IMDb, IMDb rating.

70
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,030
And here we actually need to convert that to a number.

71
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:25,150
And the reason for that is that the rating needs to be a number so that we can then do the statistics

72
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,600
here.

73
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,580
So calculating the averages.

74
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:34,490
So let's just use the number function on the IMDb rating.

75
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:39,290
And finally, we also need the runtime.

76
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:47,190
Now, if we take a look at one of the movies, you see that the runtime includes the minutes here.

77
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,190
And so again, with this, we can then later not do any calculations.

78
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:54,800
So we need to basically split that.

79
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,460
So runtime dot split.

80
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:04,160
Buy an empty string, which will just get us that first part.

81
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:13,130
And then from there we can just take that first part and then we just convert everything to a number

82
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:13,730
again.

83
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:15,770
Now here we get some problem.

84
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,290
It's because we have a duplicate.

85
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:19,480
Key.

86
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:24,260
And that's because here of course, it is the IMDb ID.

87
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,550
So thinks he has lint here for letting me know.

88
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,310
That was a pretty big problem, actually.

89
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,040
So let's see if this already works at this point.

90
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:38,290
So maybe it does.

91
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,490
Maybe it doesn't.

92
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,330
But let's see.

93
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,070
That's your console.

94
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:46,790
So there are a lot of moving pieces here, so let's check.

95
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,310
So let's add this to our list.

96
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,690
And we didn't get any error.

97
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,900
So let's go back to our list.

98
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,910
And there it is.

99
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:04,300
I mean, there are still some problems here, but something did work, so that's great.

100
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:05,890
Now.

101
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,140
I think it is because down here.

102
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,420
We are using some of these properties with their uppercase.

103
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:15,040
Uh, letters here.

104
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:20,230
So this should be title and tidal like this.

105
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,440
And.

106
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,210
Yeah, beautiful.

107
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,540
The only thing that we are missing here is the stars.

108
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,770
And so that's actually what we're going to take care of next.

109
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,800
So let's go back here.

110
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,890
And I just remembered that actually there's something else.

111
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,300
So let's say we also want to add this one.

112
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,020
So we add it to the list, but then nothing happens.

113
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:54,300
So I think that as we click here, we should probably close this movie and then basically go back.

114
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,620
And so then we can immediately see the new movie that has been added.

115
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,170
So that's not too difficult because we already have a function for that.

116
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:09,040
So it's this handle close movie.

117
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,120
And so this is the function that we now want to call here as well.

118
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,170
As soon as a new movie is added there to that list.

119
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,450
So into movie details.

120
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,910
Ah, we already have the function there.

121
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,890
Well, that's very convenient.

122
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:30,240
And yeah, of course we do have it because of.

123
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,440
Uh, this button here.

124
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:35,810
Okay.

125
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:37,250
But anyway.

126
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,010
Uh, yeah, here it is.

127
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:46,160
So after adding a movie, we then want to immediately also close the movie.

128
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,900
Okay, let's add this.

129
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,300
And so there it is again.

130
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:59,310
Now, you immediately see that there is a problem because we already have the movie on the list.

131
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:02,100
But we will take care of that a little bit later.

132
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,460
For now, let's take care of the user rating here.

133
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,150
So let's maybe just reload, which will clear our list.

134
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,480
And.

135
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:15,770
Yeah.

136
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:22,400
So basically, we want to be able to get this rating here from the user.

137
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:29,420
And then as we add to the list, that should be the rating that should be added here to this new watched

138
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,080
movie.

139
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,160
Right?

140
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:35,740
Or in other words, we now need this state that we have here.

141
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:43,220
So like this nine rating, we need it outside the star rating component and inside our movie details

142
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,120
component.

143
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:46,550
So how do we do that?

144
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:54,860
Well, remember that we actually created a way of getting that state outside the component by adding

145
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,570
in a function.

146
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,840
So we defined the on set rating prop.

147
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,800
And so into this we can pass a state set or function.

148
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,750
So then we need that state setter function.

149
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:13,370
So let's create yet another piece of state here for that rating.

150
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,810
So user.

151
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,300
Rating and set user rating.

152
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,900
So use state.

153
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,620
And here let's just start at an empty string.

154
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,600
Okay.

155
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,610
Now, for some reason we are already using this somewhere.

156
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,470
Well, not really.

157
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:44,660
So I was saying that because it wasn't with the yellow Underline.

158
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,580
But anyway, let's get this set user rating and then pass it here into.

159
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,020
Our star rating component.

160
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,060
Then let's reload.

161
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:03,270
Then let's open up this.

162
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,410
Give a rating.

163
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:09,010
And if we now check in here in our component.

164
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,460
So this we haven't done in a long time.

165
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,410
But again, this is really helpful.

166
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,690
So.

167
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,170
Here we have.

168
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,540
Oh, that reset everything.

169
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,370
Sometimes that happens when you click.

170
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:30,060
But anyway, here in our movie details, we see all the props, like the selected ID and the state.

171
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,780
So here we have, of course, the movie object that has been loading.

172
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,190
Then we have the is loading state and finally the current rating.

173
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,090
So as we click here now, you see that this changes.

174
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:48,840
And so therefore, that means that now we have this state inside our movie details component.

175
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:52,920
Of course, it's also still inside the star rating.

176
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,240
So here we have the same.

177
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,150
So of course, now that changes to ten.

178
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,770
But now it also changed to ten in movie details.

179
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:04,670
All right.

180
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:06,140
So that's really helpful.

181
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:12,350
And so now we can just add that new state right here to that object.

182
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,070
So user rating.

183
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:21,980
And now as we have this user rating, we only want to allow a movie to be added to the list if the user

184
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,450
actually gave it a rating.

185
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:28,380
So let's translate that requirement into code.

186
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:32,000
And so what I just said is basically.

187
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,300
This.

188
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:43,150
So if user rating is greater than zero, then display the button.

189
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,930
So let's reload that here manually.

190
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:53,830
Okay.

191
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,600
And so now the button is gone.

192
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,600
But then as soon as I click here, the button will appear.

193
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,800
And now edit And there it is.

194
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:03,490
So there is our eight.

195
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,690
Now, I haven't watched any of these other ones.

196
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,760
Let's just give it something.

197
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:15,810
And then indeed, we get this movie with the IMDb rating and with my own rating.

198
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:21,780
And so then the average between these two is actually correctly calculated with five and a half.

199
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,600
Great.

200
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:31,310
Now, next up, we need to ensure that I cannot just add this movie here as many times as I want.

201
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,290
So of course I can keep going and I can keep going over and over again.

202
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:43,160
So now I have the exact same movie here three times in my list, and that should not be allowed.

203
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:51,390
So basically when we come here to this component, we want to check if this movie is already in the

204
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:51,900
list.

205
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,610
And if it is, then we don't want to display any of this here.

206
00:13:56,610 --> 00:14:02,610
So then we can no longer rate it and it should then simply display the rating that we already gave.

207
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,910
All right.

208
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:11,350
Now, does that maybe sound like something that you might want to try on your own?

209
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:18,000
I know it sounds probably a bit scary, but I think you could actually do it.

210
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:24,100
So if you are up to speed with how the data flows through this application, I think you will be able

211
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:24,980
to do this.

212
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,080
So maybe take a minute or two now and then I see you back here once you are done with that.

213
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,020
All right.

214
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,750
So maybe you tried it.

215
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,500
And if not, that's also absolutely no problem.

216
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:49,660
So what we need to do is to now pass the watched array into that component, Right?

217
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,140
So that is right here.

218
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,790
So the watched array, we simply pass it as a prop.

219
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:06,870
And so then with that, we can check for each of these movies if it is already part of the watched list.

220
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,970
Okay, so let's calculate that here.

221
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,170
So a new piece of derived state, which is.

222
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,590
Is watched.

223
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:27,420
So what we need to do now is to basically check if the watched array that we need to accept here still

224
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,230
as a prop.

225
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:36,570
So we need to check if this array of objects includes the array that is currently selected.

226
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,970
So let's do that.

227
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,380
So what?

228
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:45,610
And let's first transform this simply into an array of IDs.

229
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:53,640
So we grab all the movies and then we simply take out the movie dot IMDb DB.

230
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:58,960
So let's just lock that to the console here just to make sure.

231
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:03,630
No.

232
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,450
Right.

233
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,500
Well, let's check that.

234
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:10,700
Somehow.

235
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,380
It's taking a lot of time here.

236
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,600
So right now, we have nothing on the watch list.

237
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:22,710
So let's add a couple of movies there.

238
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,350
All right.

239
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,140
And for some reason, we are getting undefined here.

240
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:31,450
Ah, but I see.

241
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:33,540
That's because here it should be IMDb.

242
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,840
I'd.

243
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,330
And indeed, now it works.

244
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,220
So we have this array now.

245
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:50,160
And so now all we need to do is to check whether this array includes the currently selected ID.

246
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,960
All right.

247
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:59,780
And now based on that, we will basically display this entire thing here.

248
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,670
So all of this.

249
00:17:04,330 --> 00:17:05,710
So let's say.

250
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,330
If is watched.

251
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,180
Well, let's start with if it's not watched, then display what we have here.

252
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:22,230
And if not, then let's just create another paragraph here.

253
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:32,860
You rated this movie And then we can also later calculate or derive the rating that we actually gave.

254
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,130
Now here we need to return yet again.

255
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,930
A piece of.

256
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,930
With a fragment.

257
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,500
So just like this.

258
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:48,820
That.

259
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,300
Yeah.

260
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,110
So here is where we then place that paragraph.

261
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,970
So working with Jayesh, as you see, can always be a bit confusing.

262
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:03,370
And even after you have done it for years, it can still take a little bit of time.

263
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,030
No.

264
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,630
Right.

265
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,970
And now you see you rated this movie.

266
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,530
And the same with this one.

267
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:16,540
But this one we haven't rated, so it's not on our list.

268
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,610
So only these two.

269
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:22,030
And so for all the other ones, we can still rate them.

270
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,630
So we tried the third one.

271
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:31,530
And so now as we click on that again, then you see that we can no longer edit to the list.

272
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,790
So that option is now gone.

273
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,490
And so we fixed that problem.

274
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:41,500
Now all we have left to do is to then place the current rating there.

275
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,030
So let's again derive that from the watched array.

276
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,640
So let's say const watched user rating.

277
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:59,750
And then let's take watched dot find.

278
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,480
So we will just find the movie.

279
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,190
Where?

280
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:14,500
The movie dot IMDb ID is equal to the selected ID and then if that exists.

281
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:20,920
And so here we are now using optional chaining because there might be actually no movie already in the

282
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,510
list.

283
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:29,110
So if we haven't watched the movie then here this find method will return nothing.

284
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:37,270
So here then we need optional chaining so that the user rating is only taken from that object in case

285
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,620
it actually exists.

286
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,420
All right.

287
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:44,630
So again, pretty standard JavaScript right here.

288
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:52,520
But if that's confusing, then yeah, as I said many times, I have a review section for all this stuff

289
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,560
right at the beginning of the course.

290
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,450
So what?

291
00:19:57,530 --> 00:20:00,740
User rating and.

292
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:02,520
Yeah.

293
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,450
Here we go.

294
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,250
You rated this movie seven?

295
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,380
Maybe let's add some nice emoji here once again.

296
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,680
So the star.

297
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,700
Where is it?

298
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,020
No.

299
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,620
Okay.

300
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,120
And so with this, we are now almost, almost done.

301
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:30,290
So all this works almost the same way as before.

302
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,330
So you see now it is here.

303
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:40,960
And our inception, for example, has the eight, which it also had here, and all the other ones have

304
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,680
the seven.

305
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,140
Okay.

306
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:49,810
And now the only thing that is left to do is the ability to also remove movies from the list.

307
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:53,520
So that's the only thing that is here in the demo app.

308
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,350
But which we do not have yet.

309
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:04,270
So this button right here where we click and it will then remove it from the list.

310
00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:06,620
All right.

311
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:10,980
So let's go again back up here where the state actually lives.

312
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:15,790
And then.

313
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:20,560
Let's add the function for handle delete.

314
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,250
What?

315
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:23,980
So then, here.

316
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,840
Let's pass in the ID.

317
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:32,620
And then here we do it just like we always do.

318
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:40,620
So we use the current watched movies array, and then we filter out the one that we no longer want.

319
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:53,910
So we get the current movie and then if movie.imdb.id is different from the passed in ID, then that

320
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:57,000
movie will stay basically in the array.

321
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:03,450
But if it's the same, then that movie will be filtered out, so it will be deleted basically.

322
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,780
And so now let's pass in this function into the list here.

323
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:15,950
So that is the what?

324
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,270
Movies list.

325
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,350
So the movies.

326
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,470
So these movies are right here.

327
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,660
They are inside the watched movies list.

328
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:31,580
And so therefore, we need to pass this function into there so that we can then pass it into each of

329
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:34,130
these movie components right there.

330
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,540
So on delete watched.

331
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:41,160
Is handle.

332
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,870
Delete watched.

333
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,800
And let's move there.

334
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:57,930
So on delete, watched, and then let's immediately pass that down into the child component.

335
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,930
So on delete watched is on.

336
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:01,530
Delete.

337
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,490
Watched.

338
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:04,730
Okay.

339
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,440
And then let's go there.

340
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,130
Oh, that's right.

341
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:08,580
Here.

342
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,550
On delete.

343
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,600
What?

344
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:16,590
And don't worry if it's taking you a lot longer to process all of this.

345
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:20,420
So to write all the code, that's just completely normal, of course.

346
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:26,330
So when I built this app here for the first time, it also took me a few hours to build this.

347
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:29,780
So it was not nearly as fast as right now.

348
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:37,220
But of course here we cannot take like 30 hours just to build one small application, right?

349
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:41,150
But anyway, here, let's now create this button.

350
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:46,760
We need to give it the class of BTN Delete.

351
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,600
And then on click.

352
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:54,550
And don't forget, it needs to be a function, not a function call.

353
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,090
So on delete, watched.

354
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:01,720
And then all we have to do is to pass in the ID.

355
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,670
So once again, that's movie dot imdb id.

356
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,050
And that should be it.

357
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:15,810
So you see that the buttons are here and let's see.

358
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:21,080
Yes, that works and our statistics get updated.

359
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,950
Now here we have still this weird thing where JavaScript is like really bad at math.

360
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:31,410
Or actually this time it looks like it's not even JavaScript's fault.

361
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:36,310
But let's just fix that because that looks just like really bad.

362
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,360
So we should be able to just append a.

363
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,570
To fixed here, hopefully.

364
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,770
Yeah, that's a lot better.

365
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,990
Let's do the same here for the rating.

366
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,300
To fixed.

367
00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:00,970
So the to here is the number of decimal points basically that we are allowing.

368
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:06,550
Uh, yeah, but anyway, that's actually it.

369
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:10,410
So you see our stats update in real time, Of course.

370
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,980
And now everything is back to zero.

371
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,690
All right.

372
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:22,950
So as I said in the beginning, it was a long lecture, but we also got a lot of stuff done.

373
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:30,150
Now, I'm aware that we moved a lot of like data up and down the tree at the same for some handler functions.

374
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:36,030
And so please, again, just make sure that you really understand what we just did here.

375
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:41,340
And with that, I think our component tree can really help you out a lot.

376
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:48,690
So just analyze all the props that all these components receive, how the state changes over time.

377
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:56,400
And so all of that will really help you out in becoming a better react developer because as I mentioned

378
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,590
many times before, you will also have to learn to work with other developers code.

379
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:08,310
And so then these skills of really analyzing the code and the data flow will become very handy.
