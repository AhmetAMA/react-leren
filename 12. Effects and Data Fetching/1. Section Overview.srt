00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:11,440
Probably 95% of all React apps out there fetch some kind of data from some API, making data fetching

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,550
an essential skill when building web applications.

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:21,970
Now one way of fetching data in a React app is inside an effect.

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,690
And so that's what this section is all about.

5
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:34,710
So in this section we'll continue working on the Use Popcorn project as we learn all about side effects.

6
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:43,000
So we're going to focus on the use effect hook, how and when effects are executed and how we can clean

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,380
effects up and loading external data into our applications.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:53,700
Finally makes them feel a lot more real world and alive.

9
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,530
And so let's quickly get started.
