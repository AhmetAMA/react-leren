1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,840
Let's now add a very simple loading indicator to our application.

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:13,900
So basically, whenever the movie data here is still being loaded in the background, we want to instead

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,650
display some kind of loading indicator right here.

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:23,860
And to show you what I mean, let's come here to the network tab, which is always a good friend when

5
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,320
we're dealing with Http requests.

6
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,550
And then let's throttle our network here to a slow 3G.

7
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:34,460
And so then I can either show you what I mean.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,690
So all of this will now take a lot of time to load, but here you now see this flash where there is

9
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,490
no content, basically.

10
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,210
So the movie data was loading but hadn't arrived yet.

11
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,580
And so now again, in the meantime, we want to display some loading indicator.

12
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,240
So in order to do that, we need some more state.

13
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:02,000
So a state variable, which basically tells our UI that the data is still being loaded.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,810
And then as soon as the data has been loaded, we want to display then the data and not that loading

15
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,010
indicator anymore.

16
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:17,720
But anyway, let's simply create that state variable and usually it is called is loading.

17
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,780
And so then set is loading.

18
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:26,030
And let's start with false.

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,400
Now then let's come here to our effect into our async function.

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:38,810
And so then right before the fetching actually starts, let's set is loading.

21
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,530
Too true.

22
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:48,090
And so this then will indicate our UI that loading is being happened and that we can then render that

23
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,900
indicator over there and then when all of this is done.

24
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,840
So let's do it right at the very end.

25
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:57,420
So this one we don't need anymore.

26
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:05,550
So here, after everything is finished, we can then set the loading state back to False.

27
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,450
And now it's very easy.

28
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,790
So here, inside this box.

29
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,050
We basically want to say that.

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:22,940
If is loading, then we want to display that indicator and I will actually create a new component for

31
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,570
that.

32
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,270
Let's call it loader.

33
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,870
Or else display that movie list.

34
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,020
Okay.

35
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:37,790
So creating that loader, that's just very simple.

36
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:43,210
We just return a paragraph with the class of loader.

37
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:52,620
And then here we can say just loading so many times in web applications, you will get like a rotating

38
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,690
spinner or something like that.

39
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,320
But you immediately saw that it was already working.

40
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,810
So as I save now the code, it will always refetch the data.

41
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,480
But let's try it again here manually.

42
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,820
Let's wait for it.

43
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,480
So now it's still the application that's being loaded.

44
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,090
So we get this white screen in the meantime.

45
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,390
But now it has started fetching the data.

46
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,910
Then it displayed that loader.

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,000
So that new component here.

48
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:30,860
But then as soon as is loading was set to false, it was time to actually display our movie list.

49
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:38,050
And so with this, this whole behavior is a bit more natural and also a bit more real world because

50
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:44,650
in all real applications, you always have some indication to the user that some data is being fetched.
