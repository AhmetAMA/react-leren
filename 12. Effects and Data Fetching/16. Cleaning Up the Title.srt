1
00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:07,610
So with our knowledge about the cleanup function, we can now very easily solve the problem that we

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:10,250
still have with our page title.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:19,040
So remember that we need a cleanup function whenever the side effect that we introduced in the effect

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,640
keeps happening after the component has already been unmounted.

5
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:26,840
And so that is actually exactly our case here.

6
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:34,130
So indeed, we no longer have the Inception movie here, but the side effect is still happening.

7
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:40,010
So the title is still showing that old movie that we had selected before.

8
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:46,130
And so the cleanup function is, of course, the perfect solution for this case.

9
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:52,490
So a cleanup function, remember, is simply a function that we return from an effect.

10
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,440
And so let's specify a function here and then.

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,800
Return it from the effect function.

12
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:02,210
Okay.

13
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:10,060
And here all we want to do is to basically reset the document title to its original form.

14
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,420
So that's use.

15
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,240
Popcorn.

16
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:16,480
And this is all we have to do.

17
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,990
So let's reload.

18
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,970
Let's select our movie.

19
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,130
Then indeed, we get the title.

20
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,410
But as we go back or title also goes back to use popcorn.

21
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,910
Great.

22
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:35,090
And so this is actually all the code that we have to write to solve this problem.

23
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:40,080
But let's just do a quick experiment just so I can show you something.

24
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,730
So let's look to the console here also in this situation.

25
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,320
Clean up effect for movie.

26
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,070
And then the title.

27
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:03,770
And here we keep getting these random errors, which is because one of these images here cannot be found.

28
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,860
So that's a bit annoying, but let's just ignore that.

29
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,930
So let's reload.

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,760
Clear the console here.

31
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,960
Then select one of the movies.

32
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:18,720
And now as I go back, we already know that this function here will get executed.

33
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,070
And so again, that's because this component here will be unmounted.

34
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:28,140
And so that's when the cleanup function of the effect will get executed.

35
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:33,020
So our title will change and let's see what is logged to the console.

36
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,270
So we get cleaned up.

37
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,400
Effect for movie Inception.

38
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:45,600
Now it might seem obvious that we get the name here, but if we think about it, it actually might seem

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,500
a bit strange, right?

40
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:54,540
Because as we learned in the previous lecture, this clean up function here will actually run after

41
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:57,150
the component has already unmounted.

42
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:03,480
And so if that's the case, then how will the function actually remember this title here?

43
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:11,410
So again, this function here runs only after the component has already disappeared from our component

44
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:11,950
tree.

45
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:16,900
And so all the state, including the movie object, has been destroyed.

46
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,500
But still our function here remembers the title.

47
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,210
So how is that?

48
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:27,880
Well, it's because of a very important concept in JavaScript called a closure.

49
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:35,290
So basically a closure in JavaScript means that a function will always remember all the variables that

50
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:40,030
were present at the time and the place that the function was created.

51
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:48,640
So in the case of our cleanup function here, it was created by the time this effect first was created

52
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,060
here.

53
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,480
And so by that time the title was actually defined as Inception.

54
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,570
So in this case, the movie that we were seeing before.

55
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,300
So it was inception at the time this function was created.

56
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:10,490
And so therefore we say that this function closed over the title variable and will therefore remember

57
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,750
it in the future.

58
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:16,430
So in this case, even after the component has already unmounted.

59
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,390
Okay.

60
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:23,360
So that was just a bit of a theoretical explanation of what happens behind the scenes, but I think

61
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,440
it's pretty important to understand this idea of closures because it is really a crucial part of how

62
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,570
effects work in React.

63
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:37,490
And therefore, we will actually also come back to this issue a bit later.

64
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:45,160
But anyway, I also want to show you that the cleanup function runs between renders.

65
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,800
So basically after each render.

66
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,800
So if we click here on some movie and then we click on another one.

67
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:54,900
Let's say this one here.

68
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,650
Then you see that the cleanup function actually run again for this movie.

69
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,080
And so that happened right after the rerender.

70
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,200
Right.

71
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,050
Let's just clean this to watch that again.

72
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,470
So as I click here, there will be a rerender.

73
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:19,250
And so again, then the previous effect was cleaned up with the previous movie that we had selected

74
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:19,970
before.
